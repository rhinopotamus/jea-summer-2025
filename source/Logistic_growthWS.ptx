			Corn farmers say that their crop is healthy if it is <q>knee high by the Fourth of July.</q> An equation that relates the height <m>H</m> (in inches) of the corn crop <m>D</m> is days since May 1 is <me>H=106-100 \ast .989^{D}</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			According to this equation, how high is corn projected to be on June 1 (day 31)?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			According to this equation, how high is corn projected to be on the Fourth of July (day 64)? Is that <q>knee high</q> (18 inches tall)?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			With stronger corn these days, the rule ought to be “chest high (52 inches) by the Fourth of July." According to this equation, when is the corn projected to be that tall? Use successive approximation to answer.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The corn matures in 110 days. How tall will it be then?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph of the function. Include when <m>D=0</m>.

			An alternative equation for corn height is <me>H = \frac{200}{1+70\ast.965^D}</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			According to this new equation, how high is corn projected to be on June 1 (day 31)?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			According to this new equation, how high is corn projected to be on the Fourth of July (day 64)? Is that <q>knee high</q> (18 inches tall)?
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			According to this new equation, on approximately what date is the corn projected to be <q>chest high</q> (52 inches tall)? Use successive approximation to answer.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The corn matures in 110 days. How tall will it be then, according to this new equation?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Add the graph of this function to your graph of the original equation on the previous problem. Again, include when <m>D=0</m>.

			Back in 1975 when my aunt and uncle bought their house upstate New York, there was a small pond in the yard. They enlarged it and stocked it with 10 small fish. The number of fish <m>F</m> increased over time, approximately according to the equation <me>F=\frac{\text{1,000}}{1+99 \ast .65^Y}</me> where <m>Y</m> measures the years since 1975.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing the fish population in 1975, 1990, 2000, and 2013.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			By the time there were over 500 fish in the pond, you could catch them with your bare hands. In approximately what year did that happen?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			In approximately what year did the fish population reach its capacity? Use successive approximations and display your calculations in a table.

			Jason works at a costume shop selling Halloween costumes. The shop is busiest during the fall before Halloween. An equation that describes the number of daily visitors <m>V</m> the shop receives <m>D</m> days from August 31 is the following: <me>V=\frac{430}{1+701\ast .81^D}</me> An alternative equation is <me>V = 700 - 690 \ast .985^D</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing what each equation predicts for August 31, September 15, September 30, October 15, October 25, October 28, and October 31.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Hint: those days are numbered 0, 15, 30, 45, 55, 58, and 61.</em>
