    <exercise xml:id="weight-change-algebraic-notation" workspace="2.8in">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Since she has been pregnant, Zoe has gained the recommended <m>\sfrac{1}{2}</m> pound per week. She weighed 153 pounds at the start of her pregnancy. That means when she is <m>T</m> weeks pregnant, that Zoe weighs <me>153 + \frac{1}{2}T</me> What does this expression say Zoe will weigh when she's 40 weeks pregnant? <em>(Story also appears in 0.4 #3 and 4.3 #3)</em>

    <exercise xml:id="wooden-balls-algebraic-notation" workspace="2.8in">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Jody is using small wooden balls to make noses for her knitted gnomes. She figured out that she can calculate the weight of each ball (in ounces) as <m>0.2 \times B \land 3</m>. Write this expression in algebraic notation. <em>(Story also appears in 0.6 #1)</em>

    <exercise xml:id="astra-rent-algebraic-notation" workspace="2.6in">
        <statement>
            <p>
                Astra lives in a 1-bedroom apartment where they pay $825 per month in rent. Thanks to new rent stabilization laws, Astra's rent can only increase 3% per year. That means after <m>T</m> years, their rent will be at most <me>825(1.03^T)</me> What does this expression say her rent could be in 5 years? <em>(Story also appears in 0.3 #2)</em>
            </p>

    <exercise xml:id="rose-gold-algebraic-notation" workspace="2.6in">
        <statement>
            <p>
                <q>Rose gold</q> is a mix of gold and copper. If we mix 2 grams of gold with <m>C</m> grams of copper, the percentage of the resulting alloy that is gold is given by the expression <me>\frac{200}{2 +C}</me> What does this expression say the percentage of gold will be if we add 7 grams of copper? <em>(Story also appears in 0.4 #2, 2.3 #2, and 4.1 Exercises)</em>
