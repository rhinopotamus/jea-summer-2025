For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $1,800. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The <term>supply</term> of flour is the amount of flour produced. It depends on the price of flour. A high price encourages producers to make more flour. If the price is low, they tend to make less of it. The dependence of the supply of flour <m>S</m> (in loads) on the price <m>P</m> (in $/pound) is given by the equation
					<me>
						\textbf{Supply: } S = 0.8P + 0.5
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <term>demand</term> of flour is the amount of flour consumers want to buy. It also depends on the price of flour. If flour sells for a high price, then consumers will buy less. If flour sells for a low price instead, then consumers will buy more. The dependence of the demand of flour <m>D</m> (in loads) on the price <m>P</m> (in $/pound) is given by the equation
					<me>
						\textbf{Demand: } D = 1.5 - 0.4 P
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <term>equilibrium price</term> of flour is the price where the supply equals the demand.

				Maria needed to replace the light bulb in the hallway. When she went to the home improvement store she was overwhelmed with the choices of light bulbs. One option is a compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb. A CFL bulb costs $1. This fixture will cost $0.95 per month to run with a CFL bulb. A different option Maria is considering is a light-emitting diode (LED) instead of a bulb. A LED costs $24 but reduces the cost for the fixture to $0.60 per month.
