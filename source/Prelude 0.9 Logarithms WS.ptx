				The number of bacteria in a dish increases 10-fold each day. Note: 10-fold means <m>\times 10</m>. Suppose we had 1 microliter of bacteria at the start of the first day. That means after <m>D</m> days there will be <m>10^D</m> microliters of bacteria.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				How many bacteria (in microliters) will there be after 1 day? After 2 days? After 3 days?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In how many days will the bacteria have reached 1 liter, which is million microliters?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				How can we use logs to find the answer?
			</p>
				</li>

				The problem continues …
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				How many days(from the start) does it take to reach the 25 millilter capacity of the petri dish, which is 25,000 microliters? Guess and check to find the answer to 1 decimal place.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				How can we use logs to find the answer?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Convert your answer to days &amp; hours format (meaning d days and h hours).
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The equation <m>pH = -\log(H^+)</m> tells us the pH of a substance (on a scale from 0 to 14) based on its molar hydrogen ion concentration <m>H^+</m>. Don’t let the notation here scare you: <m>pH</m> is a single quantity and <m>H^+</m> has nothing to do with exponents or adding.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, lemon juice has <m>H^+= .0025</m> and so the pH of lemon juice is <me>-\log(.0025) = \text{(-)} \log(.0025) = 2.6020599913 \approx 2.6</me>
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Coca-cola has <m>H^+= .000~398</m>. Find the pH of orange juice. Note: the funny spaces are to help you read the number.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Hair shampoo has <m>H^+= .000~003~162</m> Find the pH of hair shampoo.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Household bleach has <m>H^+=1.1 \times 10^{-13}</m> Find the pH of bleach.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Materials with pH values between 0-5 are <term>acidic</term>, between 9-14 are <term>basic</term>, and between 5-7 are <term>neutral</term>. Which of the above materials are acid, basic, and neutral?
			</p>

				<li>
							<p>
				In Minneapolis, apartment rent is expected to increase by 16% next year.  
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Story also appears in 0.3 #2</em>
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Astra lives in a 1-bedroom apartment where they pay $825 per month in rent. If their rent increased by 16% in how many years would their rent be doubled to $1,650. As we’ll see later, the answer is <m>\displaystyle \frac{\log(2)}{\log(1.16)}</m>. Don’t forget to the close the parentheses.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Lucky for Astra, their building is subject to rent stabilization laws and so their rent cannot increase by more than 3%. In how many years would their rent double under this cap? The answer is <m>\displaystyle \frac{\log(2)}{\log(1.03)}</m>.

				<term>When you’re done …</term>
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Check your solutions. Still confused? Work with a classmate, instructor, or tutor.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Try the <term>Do you know</term> questions. Not sure? Read the textbook and try again.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Make a list of key ideas and process to remember under <term>Don’t forget!</term>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Do the textbook exercises and check your answers. Not sure if you are close enough? Compare answers with a classmate or ask your instructor or tutor.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Getting the wrong answers or stuck? Re-read the section and try again. If you are still stuck, work with a classmate or go to your instructor’s office hours or tutor hours.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.
