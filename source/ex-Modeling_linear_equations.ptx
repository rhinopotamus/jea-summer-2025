				<p>
					Plumbers are really expensive, so I have been comparing prices. James charges $50 to show up plus $120 per hour. Jo is just getting started in the business. She charges $45 to show up plus $55 per hour. Mario advertises <q>no trip charge</q> but his hourly rate is $90 per hour. Not to be outdone, Luigi offers to unclog any drain for $150, no matter how long it takes. For each plumber, the table lists the corresponding equation and several points. In each equation, the plumber charges $<m>P</m> for <m>T</m> hours of work.

	<exercise xml:id="affordable-apartments-modeling-linear" component="not-workbook">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				We looked at the city's plan to increase the number of affordable apartments. From a current estimate of 64,100 apartments classified as <q>affordable,</q> they hoped to build 7,800 per year. At that rate, they can reach a total of 150,000 apartments in 12 years.
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Things change. Revised estimates call for only 6,200 new apartments each year. At that rate, when will the city reach the 150,000 apartments goal? Using the same variables as in this section, set up and solve an equation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						More bad news. The definition of <q>affordable</q> has changed again, so the new count shows only 48,700 apartments on the list. And still only 6,200 new apartments each year. Now when will the city reach the 150,000 apartments goal? Set up and solve an equation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						In light of the new definition and, consequently, only 48,700 apartments currently on the list, the city has received additional funding to up the number of apartments built each year. They would like to return to their goal of having 150,000 affordable apartments in 12 years. How many apartments do they need to add each year to reach that goal? Figure out the answer however you like, but check that it works.
