		<introduction>
			<p>
				After his first beer, Stephen's blood alcohol content (BAC) was already 0.04 and as he continued to drink, his BAC level rose 45% per hour. The equation is <me>S = 0.04 \ast 1.45^T</me> where <m>S</m> is Stephen's BAC and <m>T</m> is the time, measured in hours.
				<em>(Story also appears in 1.1 #4 and 2.4 Exercises)</em>

					Make a table showing Stephen's BAC at the start of the story (<m>T=0</m>) and each of the next four hours.

					At a BAC of 0.10 it is illegal for Stephen to drive. When will that happen? Set up and solve an equation using the <term>Log Divides Formula</term>. Answer to the nearest minute.

				Chlorine is used to disinfect water in swimming pools. The chlorine concentration decreases as the pool is used according to the equation <me>C = 2.5 \ast 0.975^T</me> where <m>C</m> is the chlorine concentration in parts per million (ppm) and <m>T</m> is the time in hours since the concentration was first measured. <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="chlorine-pool-growth-factor"/>)</em>

				Dontrell and Kim borrowed money to buy a house on a 30-year mortgage.

					They have been in the house for 5 years now and due to a downturn in the housing market, their house is worth only $150,000. Are they <term>underwater</term>, meaning do they owe more than the house is worth?
