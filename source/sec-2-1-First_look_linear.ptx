			You're expecting family for dinner in a few hours and, wouldn't you know it, but your kitchen sink is clogged. The bottle of drain opener didn't clear it out. Your brother-in-law has offered to help, but last time he tried he only made it worse. If you decide to call the plumber, what will it cost?

		<title>Calculating what the plumber costs</title>

		<p>
			You looked up a local plumber and asked about his rates. The plumber will charge you $100 just to come to your house. In addition, there will be a charge of $75 per hour for the service.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			For example, if the plumber takes one hour, then he'll charge you $100 for showing up and $75 for the one hour of work. So, the total plumber's bill will be 
			<me>100 + 75 = \$175</me> 
		</p>

		<p>
			For two hours, there's still the $100 charge, but also $75 for each of the two hours. That's an additional charge of 
			<me>2 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} =2 \times 75= \$150</me> 
			So, the total plumber's bill will be 
			<me>\$100 + \$150 = \$250</me> 
			Try this calculation all at once. 
			<me>\$100 + 2 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = 100 + 2 \times 75 = \$250</me> 
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's hope it wouldn't take the plumber as long as three hours, but if it did, we can do a similar calculation. Add the trip charge of $100 to the additional charge of $75 for each of the three hours. The plumber's bill would be 
			<me>\$100 + 3 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = 100 + 3 \times 75 = \$325</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			What would it cost if the plumber takes only <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> hour? The plumber's bill would be 
			<me>\$100 + \frac{1}{2} \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} =100 + 0.5 \times 75  = \$100 + \$37.50 = \$137.50</me> 
			Notice we used <m>\frac{1}{2}=1 \div 2 = 0.5</m>. Bet you knew that.
		</p>

		<p>
			What would happen if the plumber was taking so long to get to your house that before he got there you dumped another bottle of drain opener in the sink and that did the trick? But before you could call and cancel the plumber, wouldn't you know it, there he was. What do you owe him for that 0 hours of work? Probably $100. Unless your plumber says to <q>forget it.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			We see that the plumber's charge depends on the amount of time it takes to unclog the sink. We can name these variables.
			<md>
				<mrow>T \amp= \text{ time plumber takes (hours) } \sim \text{ indep} </mrow>
				<mrow>P \amp= \text{ total plumber's charge (\$) } \sim \text{ dep} </mrow>
			</md>
			Let's summarize our calculations about <m>T</m> and <m>P</m> by making a table to describe how the plumber's bill is a function of his work time.

	<subsection component="not-workbook" xml:id="ss-2-1-generalizing">
		<title>Making our calculations more general</title>

		<p>
			Each time we knew how long the plumber spent and calculated the plumber's bill <m>P</m> by starting with the trip charge of $100 and adding in $75 times the number of hours. For example, for 3 hours we calculated <me>\$100 + 3 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = \$325</me> We have a name for the number of hours in general; it is <m>T</m>. So for <m>T</m> hours, we would calculate <me>\$100 + T \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}}=P</me> See how we just put the <m>P</m> in for $325 and <m>T</m> where the 3 hours was? We're just generalizing from our example. Drop the units and we have our equation. If the plumber works for <m>T</m> hours, then the cost is $<m>P</m> where <me>P = 100 + T \ast 75</me> We started the equation <q><m>P=</m></q> because it is a convention to begin equations with the dependent variable, when possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			An <term>equation</term> is a formula that shows how the value of the dependent variable (like <m>P</m>) depends on the value of the independent variable (like <m>T</m>). We usually write an equation in the form <me>\text{dep} = \text{formula involving indep}</me> The equation is another way to describe a function, and efficient one - an equation carries a lot of information in only a few symbols.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is a mathematical convention that we write numbers before letters in an equation. So, instead of <m>T \ast 75</m> we should write <m>75 \ast T</m>. There's a conventional shorthand for this product: when a number and letter are next to each other, it means that they are multiplied. So, instead of <m>75 * T</m> we should write <m>75T</m>. Thus our equation is normally written as <me>P = 100 + 75T.</me> You'll have to remember the hidden multiplication when you're calculating.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you wanted to write the equation as <me>P = 75T + 100,</me> that would be okay too. We can add the $100 trip charge first, like we did in our examples, or at the end. Same answer.
		</p>

		<xi:include href="./activities/act-2-1-equation-truck.ptx" />

		<p>
			Suppose the plumber shows up at your house and repaired the sink in 25 minutes. Whew! No sooner do you pay your bill than your first dinner guest arrives. How much do you owe the plumber? Notice that <me>25 \text{ minutes} \ast \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 25 \div 60 = 0.4166666\ldots \text{ hours}</me> Therefore for 25 minutes we have <m>T \approx 0.4166 \text{ hours}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Using our equation we get <me>P = 100 + 75\ast 0.4166 = 100 + 75 \times {0.4166} = 131.245 \approx \$131.25.</me> It was important that we rounded off our final answer because we had rounded off to get 0.4166 along the way. We could have done the entire calculation at once (avoiding the round off error) as <me>100 + 75 \times 25 \div 60 =131.25</me> Either way, we owe the plumber $131.25.

		<title>Graphing linear functions</title>

		<p>
			Why are these kinds of functions called <q>linear</q>, anyway? Good question. Turns out that any time we have a linear function, if we plot the points from the table of values in a graph, we see that the points lie on a straight line. In Chapter 1 we highlighted the points from our table on the graph. It is more common to just show the smooth curve or line.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is a graph of the points from the plumber's charge function.

		<p>
			Why is the graph a straight line? Remember that the <xref ref="rate-of-change" text="custom">rate of change</xref> tells us how steep the graph is. For example, let's find the rate of change between 1 hour and 2 hours. <me>\text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$250 - \$175}{2 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour}} = \frac{\$75}{1 \text{ hour}} = \$75 \text{ per hour}</me> Sure! We knew that. The plumber charges an extra $75 for each extra hour he works. The rate of change is precisely $75/hour, no matter where we calculate it. Since the rate of change is constant, the graph is the same steepness everywhere. So, the graph is a straight line, and the function is <term>linear</term>. Another way to say this is a function with constant rate of change is <term>linear</term>. The plumber's total charge is a linear function of time.

		<title>A template for linear equations</title>
		
		<p>
			Just like we generalized from our specific calculations for the plumber's cost to write down an equation that would work for <em>any</em> amount of time, we can generalize our work in this entire story to notice a pattern that <em>any</em> linear equation would follow. In this book we call a pattern like this a <term>template</term>.
			<aside>
				<p>
					Here is an example of a template that helps artists draw shapes quickly and accurately.

			</aside>
		</p>

		<p>
			Look back at our equation for the plumber's total charge. <me>P = 100 + 75T</me> Any linear equation fits this template.
		</p>

		<assemblage xml:id="linear-eq-template">
			<title>Linear Equation Template</title>

					\text{dep} = \text{start} + \text{slope} \ast \text{indep}
				</me>
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Notice our two variables are in our equation and there are two <term>constants</term>. Each constant has its own meaning. The first constant is 100 and it is measured in dollars. It is the trip charge, the set amount we would owe the plumber even if he does 0 hours work. In our standard form we refer to this quantity as the <term>starting value</term> (or <term>start</term> for short), but its official name is <term>intercept</term>. On the graph it's where the line crosses the vertical axis. Think of a football player (running along the vertical axis) intercepting a pass (coming in the line). We can find the intercept from our equation by plugging in <m>T = 0</m> so that <me>P = 100 + 75 \times 0 = 100</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The second constant is 75, and though it's tempting to say it is measured in dollars, it is really measured in dollars per hour (<m>\frac{\text{\$}}{\text{hour}}</m>). This number is the rate of change, and in the context of linear equations it gets its own name too: it's called the <term>slope</term>. Since the rate of change measures the steepness of any curve or line, the word <q>slope</q>, like mountain slope, makes sense. In our plumber example the intercept was $100 and the slope was $75/hour.
