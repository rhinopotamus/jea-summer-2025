	<introduction>
		<p>
			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don't spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<term>Over 50 points on this exam are for solving equations and inequalities. Be sure you understand what you need to show for full credit. Using a different method will get little to no partial credit.</term>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don't forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>

	<exercise xml:id="well-linear-PE3A">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The Skärstroms want to dig a new well for water for their lake cabin. The company charges $900 to bring the equipment on site and draw the permit and then $2 per foot to dig. That means <me>W=900+2F</me> where <m>F</m> is the depth of the well (in feet) and <m>W</m> is the cost of the well (in $).
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task workspace="0.5in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					In their neck of the woods, wells often run 200 feet deep. According to the equation, how much would that cost?
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task workspace="1in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					The Skärstroms have budgeted between $1,500 and $1,800 for the well. Set up and solve a chain of inequalities to find the corresponding range of depths.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task workspace="0.5in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					No such luck. The company had to drill much deeper than hoped to find water. The final result, wonderfully cold and clear drinking water. And, a hefty bill for $2,072. How deep is their well? Set up and solve an equation.

	<exercise xml:id="caffeine-PE3A">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Ceyda starts the day by downing two cans of Red Bull, containing a total of 160 mg of caffeine. Her body eliminates the caffeine at a rate of 12% each hour. That means the amount of caffeine (<m>C</m> mg) after <m>H</m> hours is given by the equation graphed below <me>C= 160\ast 0.88^H</me>

		</introduction>
		<task workspace="0.5in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					According to the equation, how much caffeine is in her body initially, after 2 hours, 5 hours, and 24 hours? Display your answers in table.

		<task workspace="1in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Show show to use successive approximation to find <em>approximately</em> when Ceyda's caffeine level first drops below 20 mg. Answer to the nearest hour.

			</statement>
		</task>
		<task workspace="1in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Set up and solve an equation to determine <em>exactly</em> when Ceyda's caffeine level first drops below 20 mg. Round your answer to two decimal places.
