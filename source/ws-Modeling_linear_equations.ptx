				A solar heating system costs approximately $30,000 to install and $150 per year to run. By comparison, a gas heating system costs approximately $12,000 to install and $700 per year to run. <em>(Story also appears in 4.2 Exercises)</em>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Since a very popular e-book reader was released, the price has been decreasing at a constant rate. A blogger developed the following equation representing the price <m>E</m> of the e-book reader <m>T</m> months since it was released: <me>E = 359 - 12T</me>

					If you can believe what you read in blogs, the manufacturer will soon be giving away the e-book reader for free, since they make money on the e-book sales themselves. How many months after it was released would that happen, according to our equation? Set up and solve an equation.

				Plumbers are really expensive, so I have been comparing prices. James charges $50 to show up plus $120 per hour. Jo is just getting started in the business. She charges $45 to show up plus $55 per hour. Mario advertises <q>no trip charge</q> but his hourly rate is $90 per hour. Not to be outdone, Luigi offers to unclog any drain for $150, no matter how long it takes. For each plumber, the table lists the corresponding equation and several points. In each equation, the plumber charges $<m>P</m> for <m>T</m> hours of work. <em>(Story also appears in 2.1 Exercises)</em>
