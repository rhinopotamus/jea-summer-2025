			<introduction>
				<p>
					One variety of blueberry plant yields an average of 130 blueberries per season but there is quite a bit of variability from plant to plant. One measure of this variability is the standard deviation, which is approximated at 16.4 berries. Given a plant yielding <m>B</m> blueberries, we can calculate how usual or unusual that is by computing its <term>(standard) z-score</term> using the equation <me>Z = \frac{B-130}{16.4}</me>
					For example, a plant yielding <m>B=130</m> blueberries has z-score of 0. A plant yielding <m>B = 138</m> blueberries has z-score of <me>Z=\frac{138-130}{16.4} = (\underline{138}-130)\div 16.4 = 0.4878\ldots \approx 0.48</me> Answer each question by evaluating; setting up and solving an equation; or setting up and solving an inequality, whichever is appropriate.

	<exercise xml:id="potato-chips-linear-ineq" component="not-workbook">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				A manufacturer makes family-sized bags of potato chips, advertised as containing 200 grams each. In fact it's difficult to control the exact weight of a bag of potato chips, so it varies. The standard deviation is rather high, about 3.8 grams per bag. The company would rather have bags too heavy than too light, lest they be accused of false advertising, so their average bag actually weighs 207 grams. It turns out that approximately 97% of all bags of chips weigh 200 grams or more. We can compute the standard <m>Z</m>-score of a given bag of chips weighing <m>B</m> grams using the equation <me>Z = \frac{B-207}{3.8}</me>
