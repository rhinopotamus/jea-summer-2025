			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you’re not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don’t spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you’re not sure about something.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don’t forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>

			Forde collects miniature cars, each weighing 1.76 ounces. His car box weighs 4 ounces when empty. The total weight <m>T</m> ounces of Forde’s car box depends on the number of cars <m>C</m> according to the equation <me>T=4+1.76C</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table of values showing the weight if it contains 1, 5, 12, or 20 cars.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph illustrating the dependence.

			How many cars can Forde fit in the box and stay under 3 pounds (that is 48 ounces)? Figure out the answer and mark the corresponding point on your graph.

			Will women ever run the marathon as fast as men do? The world records are getting close. In 2012 the men’s record was 2:03:38 and the women’s record was 2:15:25, about 12 minutes apart! On the other hand, the record is changing very slowly. Estimates for the men’s time shows about 13 seconds drop per year on average. Estimates for the women’s time shows about 26 seconds drop per year on average.

			Write an equation for each function: men’s and women’s. Use <m>T</m> for the marathon times (in seconds) and <m>Y</m> for the years (measured in years since 2012). Note that 2:03:38 <m>= \text{7,418}</m> seconds and 2:12:25 <m>= \text{7,945}</m> seconds.

			Set up and solve a system to estimate when the women’s record might equal the men’s record.

			An online music club charges a monthly enrollment fee plus $.95 per album you download. Last month Andrew downloaded 31 albums for a total cost of $49.00.

			A report shows September sea-ice declining in the Northern hemisphere. In 1980 the extent of the sea-ice was 3.1 million square miles. By 2012, the sea-ice extended only 1.7 million square miles. For this problem, suppose that the area of sea-ice decreases linearly.
