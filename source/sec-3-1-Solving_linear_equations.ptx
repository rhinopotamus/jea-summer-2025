			Back in <xref ref="ch-2-Equations" text="type-global"/>, we've mostly been learning about <term>evaluating</term> functions: given a particular value of the independent variable, figuring out the resulting value of the dependent variable. You might call this process <q>plugging in.</q>
		</p>

		<p>
			Here in <xref ref="ch-3-Solving_equations" text="type-global"/>, we will instead be interested in <term>solving</term> equations: given a particular value of the dependent variable, figuring out what value of the independent variable it came from. 
		</p>

		<assemblage>
			<title>Solutions, solving, and evaluating</title>
			<p>
				A <term>solution</term> to an equation is the value of the independent variable we plug in to get the desired value of the dependent variable.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we are <term>solving</term> an equation, this means we know a value of the dependent variable (an output) and we want to figure out the corresponding value of the independent variable (the input) that produced it.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we are <term>evaluating</term> a function, this means we know a value of the independent variable (an input) and we want to figure out the corresponding value of the dependent variable (the output).
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Another way to think about the difference between <term>evaluating</term> and <term>solving</term> is that it is the difference between <alert>doing</alert> and <alert>undoing</alert>. When we <alert>evaluate</alert> a function, we are <alert>doing</alert> the steps in the equation to the input, so that we can figure out the corresponding output. On the other hand, when we <alert>solve</alert> an equation, we already have the output, so we want to <alert>undo</alert> all the things that the equation said to do. That way we can get back to the original input.

		<title>Figuring out the plumber's time</title>
		
		<p>
			Your kitchen sink keeps getting clogged. Very annoying. Last time the plumber was able to fix it pretty quickly. But now the sink is clogged again. This time when the plumber comes and unclogs the sink, he suggests redoing the trap and a few other things that were causing the problem. You are pretty tired of it clogging up and tell him to <q>go ahead.</q> While you're glad that the sink works when he's done, you're a bit shocked when his bill arrives a few days later for parts plus $278.75 in labor. Does that seem right?
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember our plumber charged $100 for just showing up and then $75 per hour for the service. Using the variables
			<md>
				<mrow>T \amp= \text{ time plumber takes (hours) } \sim \text{ indep}</mrow>
				<mrow>P \amp= \text{ total plumber's charge (\$) } \sim \text{ dep}</mrow>
			</md>
			we found that the equation was 
			<me>P=100+75T</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's figure out how many hours of work would add up to a bill of $278.75. Our first approach might be to look at a table. From earlier we had
		</p>


		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor" halign="center" row-headers="yes">

				<cell right="minor">250.00</cell>
				<cell right="minor">325.00</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

		<p>
			Since $278.75 is between $250.00 and $325.00, we see that the time must be between 2 and 3 hours. You remember the plumber being there over 2 hours, so this is certainly a reasonable answer. Well, a lot of money, but mathematically it makes sense.

			Still curious, you'd like to know exactly how many hours and minutes the plumber worked. We could use <xref ref="sec-2-4-Approx_solutions" text="custom">successive approximation</xref>. For example, for 2.5 hours the bill would have been 
			<me>P=100 + 75 \ast 2.5 = 100+75\times \underline{2.5}=\$287.50</me>

			The plumber worked approximately 2.38 hours. Converting units we calculate 
			<me>
				0.38 \cancel{\text{ hours}} \ast  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \cancel{\text{ hour}}} = 0.38 \times 60 = 22.8 \approx 23 \text{ minutes}
			</me> 
			The plumber took about 2 hours, 23 minutes. Thinking back, the plumber had arrived around 10:30 in the morning and stayed past lunch, probably until around 1:00 p.m. That's about right.

		<title>Solving symbolically</title>
		
		<p>
			Wait a minute! We could have figured the plumber's cost out much more quickly. If the labor cost was $278.75, we know the first $100 was the trip charge. That leaves 
			<me>\$278.75-\$100.00 = \$178.75</me> 
			in hourly charges. At $75 per hour that comes to 
			<me>\$178.75\ast  \frac{1\text{ hour}}{\$75}=178.75 \div 75 = 2.3883333\ldots \approx 2.388 \text{ hours}</me> 
			which comes to around 2 hours, 23 minutes as before. See how we used the $75/hour as a unit conversion here? Very clever.
		</p>

		<p>
			That worked well. But, can we figure out this sort of calculation in other problems? What is the general method we're using? Can we write down our method in an organized fashion so that someone else could follow our thinking here? Turns out there is a formal way to show this calculation, called <term>(symbolically) solving</term> the equation. Officially <em>any</em> method of getting a solution to an equation is considered solving the equation, but in the rest of this book, and in most places that use algebra, when we refer to <q>solving the equation</q> or give the instruction to <term>solve</term>, we mean <em>symbolically</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's how it works. We want to figure out when <m>P=278.75</m>. We know from our equation that <m>P = 100 + 75T</m>. So we want to find the time <m>T</m> where 
			<me>100 + 75T=278.75</me> 
			<aside>
				<p>
					Another way to think about what is happening here is that we are replacing <m>P</m> in the equation by the number <m>278.75</m> that we are interested in.
				</p>
			</aside>
			Remember that the equal sign means that the two sides are the same number. On the left-hand side we have <m>100 + 75T</m>. On the right-hand side we have <m>278.75</m>. Looks different, but same thing: both of them are <m>P</m>. 
			We are looking for the value of <m>T</m> that makes these two sides equal.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first thing we did was subtract the $100 trip charge. In this formal method, we subtract 100 from each side of our equation. If the left-hand side and the right-hand side are the same number, then they will still be equal when we take away 100 from each side. We get 
			
			<md alignment="alignat">
				<mrow>\cancel{100}\amp + 75T \amp =\amp  278.75 </mrow>
				<mrow>-\cancel{100}\amp \amp \amp -100 </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			which simplifies to <me>75T=278.75-100=178.75</me> because the <m>+100</m> and <m>-100</m> cancelled.
		</p>

		<p>
			The next thing we did to figure out the answer was divide by the $75/hour charge. In this formal method, we can divide each side of our equation by 75. Again, if the left-hand side and right-hand side are the same number, then they will still be equal when we divide by 75. Here goes. <me>\frac{\cancel{75}T}{\cancel{75}}=\frac{178.75}{75}</me> Notice that we wrote the division in fraction form (instead of using <m>\div</m>). To understand why the 75's cancelled, remember that <m>75T</m> is short for <m>75\ast T</m> and so <me>\frac{75T}{75} = \frac{75\ast T}{75} = 75 \times T \div 75=T</me> because the <m>\times 75</m> and <m>\div 75</m> cancelled. So we have <me>T = \frac{178.75}{75} = 178.75 \div 75 = 2.3883333\ldots</me> as before. Yet again, our answer is around 2 hours, 23 minutes.
		</p>

		<p>
			This calculation is a good example of the <xref ref="assemblage-shoes-and-socks" text="title"/>. To evaluate the function <m>P = 100 + 75T</m>, we would do the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Multiply by 75
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Add 100
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			And so, when we solved, we did the <alert>opposite steps</alert> in the <alert>opposite order</alert>. The opposite of adding 100 is subtracting 100, and the opposite of multiplying by 75 is dividing by 75:
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Subtract 100
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Divide by 75
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

		<title>Another plumber cost</title>

		<p>
			Let's practice working with this symbolic way of solving equations. Suppose instead the plumber went to my neighbor's house and billed her for $160 in labor costs. How long did the plumber work at my neighbor's? As before, we begin with our equation 
			<me>P = 100 + 75T</me> 
			and we are looking for <m>P=160</m>. Replace <m>P</m> in the equation by 160 to get 
			<me>100+75T =160</me> 
		</p>
		<p>
			Remember, opposite steps in opposite order: First, subtract 100 from each side to get 
			<md alignment="alignat">
				<mrow>\cancel{100}\amp + 75T \amp  =\amp  160 </mrow>
				<mrow>-\cancel{100}\amp \amp \amp -100 </mrow>
			</md>
			which simplifes to 
			<me>75T=160-100=60</me> 
			Last, divide each side by 75 to get 
			<me>\frac{\cancel{75}T}{\cancel{75}}=\frac{60}{75}</me> 
			which simplifies to 
			<me>T = \frac{60}{75} = 60\div75=0.8 \text{ hours}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			We have solved the equation, but it would make more sense to report our answer in minutes so we convert <me>0.8 \cancel{\text{ hours}} \ast \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \cancel{\text{ hour}}} = 0.8 \times 60 = 48 \text{ minutes}</me> The plumber worked for 48 minutes at my neighbor's house.
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember that we can always check our work by evaluating. Since <m>T</m> is measured in hours we need to go back and use <m>T= 0.8</m> hours, not 48 which is in minutes. Evaluating in our original function we get <me>P=100 + 75 \ast 0.8 = 100+75\times\underline{0.8}= 160 \quad \checkmark</me>
