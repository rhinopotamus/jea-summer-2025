        <introduction>
            <p>
                A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)

        <introduction>
            <p>
                A recent news report stated that cell phone usage is growing exponentially in developing countries. In one small country, 50,000 people owned a cell phone in the year 2000. It was estimated that usage would increase at 1.4% percent per year.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                If a person has a heart attack and their heart stops beating, the amount of time it takes paramedics to restart their heart with a defibrillator is critical. Each minute that passes decreases the person's chance of survival by 10%.<aside>Source: American Red Cross</aside> Assume that this statement means the decrease is exponential and that the survival rate is 100% if the defibrillator is used immediately.
