		<introduction>
			<p>
				Madison wants to buy a new car, either Car A: a hybrid priced at $26,100, or Car B: a high-efficiency gas car priced at $23,700. Annual fuel costs for Car A are currently $1,100. For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $1,800. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.

				A mug of coffee costs $3.45 at Juan's favorite cafe, unless he buys their discount card for $10 in which case a mug costs $2.90. Or, he can buy a membership for $59.99 and then coffee is only $1/mug. If we let <m>M</m> represent the number of mugs of coffee he buys and <m>T</m> represent the total cost in dollars, then the equations are:

		<introduction>
			<p>
				The <term>supply</term> of flour is the amount of flour produced. It depends on the price of flour. A high price encourages producers to make more flour. If the price is low, they tend to make less of it. The dependence of the supply of flour <m>S</m> (in loads) on the price <m>P</m> (in $/pound) is given by the equation
				<me>
					\textbf{Supply: } S = 0.8P + 0.5
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <term>demand</term> of flour is the amount of flour consumers want to buy. It also depends on the price of flour. If flour sells for a high price, then consumers will buy less. If flour sells for a low price instead, then consumers will buy more. The dependence of the demand of flour <m>D</m> (in loads) on the price <m>P</m> (in $/pound) is given by the equation
				<me>
					\textbf{Demand: } D = 1.5 - 0.4 P
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				The <term>equilibrium price</term> of flour is the price where the supply equals the demand.
