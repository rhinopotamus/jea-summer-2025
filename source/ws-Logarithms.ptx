                The number of bacteria in a dish increases 10-fold each day. Note: 10-fold means <m>\times 10</m>. Suppose we had 1 microliter of bacteria at the start of the first day. That means after <m>T</m> days there will be <m>10^T</m> microliters of bacteria.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                The equation <m>pH = -\log(H^+)</m> tells us the pH of a substance (on a scale from 0 to 14) based on its molar hydrogen ion concentration <m>H^+</m>. Don't let the notation here scare you: <m>pH</m> is a single quantity and <m>H^+</m> has nothing to do with exponents or adding.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                For example, lemon juice has <m>H^+= 0.0025</m> and so the pH of lemon juice is <me>-\log(0.0025) = \text{(-)} \log(0.0025) = 2.6020599913 \approx 2.6</me>

                In Minneapolis, apartment rent is expected to increase by 16% next year.

                    Astra lives in a 1-bedroom apartment where they pay $825 per month in rent. If their rent increased by 16%, in how many years would their rent be doubled to $1,650? As we'll see later, the answer is <m>\displaystyle \frac{\log(2)}{\log(1.16)}</m>. Don't forget to close the parentheses.

                    Lucky for Astra, their building is subject to rent stabilization laws and so their rent cannot increase by more than 3%. In how many years would their rent double under this cap? The answer is <m>\displaystyle \frac{\log(2)}{\log(1.03)}</m>.
