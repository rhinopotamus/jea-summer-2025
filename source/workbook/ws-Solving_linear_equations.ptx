	<exercise xml:id="comedy-anxiety-solving-linear" workspace="0.8in">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Is laughter really the best medicine? A study examined the impact of comedy on anxiety levels. Subjects' anxiety levels were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 before and after the study. Levels averaged 4.3 before the study. There was no significant change in subjects in the control group. Subjects who watched the comedy videos showed a noticeable difference, and it depended on the hours of comedy watched. Anxiety levels fell an average of 0.098 (on the 1 to 5 scale) for each hour of comedy watched.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Name the variables. Anxiety is measured on a unitless scale.

			<statement>
				<p>
					Make a table showing average anxiety levels for subjects who watched comedy videos for 0 hours (control group), 2 hours, 10 hours, and 20 hours, according to these findings.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Use successive approximation to guess the <em>approximate</em> number of hours watching comedy needed to lower the average anxiety level below 2.

		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Write an equation relating the variables.
