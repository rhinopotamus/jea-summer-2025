	<title>Practice Exam 3B</title>

<page>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			<em>Try taking this version of the practice exam under testing conditions: no book, no notes, no classmate's help, no electronics (computer, cell phone, television). Give yourself one hour to work and wait until you have tried your best on all of the problems before checking any answers.</em>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<term>Caution:</term> Usually more than half points on this exam are for solving equations and inequalities. Be sure you understand what you need to show for full credit. Using a different method, or not showing enough work might get little to no partial credit.

				Goldie the Goldfish, Pinches the Lobster, Quackers the Duck, Speedy the Turtle.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Best we can tell, the floor of our front porch was 7<prime/>2<dblprime/> above ground when the house was built. It has been slowly sinking ever since. The contractor estimated that it's dropped 0.45 inches per year. The equation is <me>P = 86-0.45A</me> where <m>P</m> is the height of the porch (in inches) and <m>A</m> is the age of the house (in years).

				In a <term>shot put</term> competition, athletes try to throw a heavy metal ball as far as possible. For one athlete the ball closely followed the parabolic arch given by the equation <me>H = -0.015D^{2}+1.04D+5.9</me> where <m>D</m> was the distance the ball had travelled horizontally and <m>H</m> was the height of the ball above ground, both in feet.
