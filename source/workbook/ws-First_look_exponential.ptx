		<introduction>
			<p>
				The comprehensive fee at a local private college is $37,000. The fee is projected to increase 5.8% per year.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Calculate the annual growth factor.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					What do you expect the comprehensive fee will be in five years?
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Name the variables, including units, and write an equation describing the dependence.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Make a table of values showing the comprehensive fee now, in 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and 50 years (even though that's not realistic).

		<task workspace="0in">
			<statement>

					Draw a graph illustrating the function.

	<exercise xml:id="bunnies-first-look-exponential" workspace="1.5in">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Bunnies, bunnies, everywhere. They eat the tops of my tulips in early spring and my lilies all summer long. Back in 2007 there were an estimated 1,800 rabbits in my neighborhood. Rabbits multiply quickly, 13% per year by one estimate.

					Name the variables, including dependency.

				<p>
					Calculate the annual growth factor.

					What does this story suggest the rabbit population was in 2010? In 2013?

	<exercise xml:id="flu-dorm-first-look-exponential">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				A flu virus has been spreading through the college dormitories. Initially 8 students were diagnosed with the flu, but that number has been growing 16% per day. <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="flu-dorm-modeling-exponential"/> and 5.5 textbook)</em>
			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task workspace="1in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Calculate the daily growth factor and use it to write an equation describing the spread of the virus. Don't forget to name the variables too.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task workspace="1in">
			<statement>
				<p>
					Make a table and graph for the six weeks following the initial diagnosis. (That means use 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days.)
				</p>
				<xi:include href="GraphPaper.ptx" />
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					What is a realistic domain? That means, for how many days do you think this model is reasonable? To keep a sense of scale, there are 1,094 students currently living in the dorms.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				My savings account earns a modest amount of interest, the equivalent of 0.75% annually. I have $12,392.18 in the account now.

					How much <em>interest</em> will I earn this year? What will my <em>balance</em> be at the end of the year?

					What will my balance be in three years, assuming I neither deposit nor withdraw money?

					What would the equation be if I moved $10,000 into that certificate of deposit, and kept the rest in savings? <em>Hint: to find the total balance, add the amounts.</em>
