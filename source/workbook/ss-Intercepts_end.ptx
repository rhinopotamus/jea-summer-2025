				What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				How to calculate the intercept given the slope and an example (another point on the graph)?
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				Why an intercept might not make sense, for example if it's outside the domain of the function?

		<li>
			<p>
				When a linear function is a direct proportion?
			</p>

		<li>
			<p>
				Why you cannot reason proportionally if the linear function is not a direct proportion?
