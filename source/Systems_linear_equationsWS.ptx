			Madison wants to buy a new car, either Car A: a hybrid priced at $, or Car B: a high-efficiency gas car priced at $. Annual fuel costs for Car A are currently $. For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write a linear equation for the total cost (including purchase price and fuel costs) of Car A and write another linear equation for the total cost of Car B each as a function of how long she keeps it. Assume fuel costs are constant.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table comparing the total costs for the two cars if Madison keeps the car she buys for 3, 5, or 10 years.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Set up and solve a system of linear equations to determine the <term>payoff time</term>, or the number of years for which the total costs of each car are equal.
		</p>

					<p>
			Based on what you have learned, fill in the blank.

			A mug of coffee costs $3.45 at Juan’s favorite cafe, unless he buys their discount card for $10 in which case a mug costs $2.90. Or, he can buy a membership for $59.99 and then coffee is only $1/mug. If we let <m>M</m> represent the number of mugs of coffee he buys and <m>T</m> represent the total cost in dollars, then the equations are:

			Ahmed planted two shrubs in the backyard on May 1. The virburnum was 16.9 inches tall and expected to grow .4 inches each week this summer. The weigela was 20.3 inches tall but only expected to grow .2 inches per week. If we let <m>S</m> represent the total height of the shrub in inches after <m>W</m> weeks, then the equations are:

			The <term>supply</term> of flour is the amount of flour produced. It depends on the price of flour. A high price encourages producers to make more flour. If the price is low, they tend to make less of it. The dependence of the supply of flour S (in loads) on the price P (in $/pound) is given by the equation

			The <term>demand</term> of flour is the amount of flour consumers want to buy. It also depends on the price of flour. If flour sells for a high price, then consumers will buy less. If flour sells for a low price instead, then consumers will buy more. The dependence of the demand of flour D (in loads) on the price P (in $/pound) is given by the equation
