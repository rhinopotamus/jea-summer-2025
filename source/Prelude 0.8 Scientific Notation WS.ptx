							<p>
				In each story, write out the highlighted numbers (with all the zeros).

				Melvin was looking populations based on the 2020 Census and saw the population of Saint Paul, MN listed as <m>\mathbf{3.10942 \times 10^{5}}</m> <term>people</term>. Hint: you can check the answer to this part by evaluating on your calculator.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The gross domestic product (GDP) measures the market value of all final goods and services produced by an economy. The United States GDP is approximately <m>\mathbf{\$2.332 \times 10^{13}}</m>. <em>Story also appears in 1.5 #1</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The Earth weighs approximately <m>\mathbf{5.972 \times 10^{24}}</m> <term>kilograms</term>.

				In each story, write out the highlighted numbers (with all the zeros).
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Alpaca have very fine hairs (which can be spun into yarn to make very soft sweaters). The width of an alpaca hair is around <m>\mathbf{2.5 \times 10^{-7}}</m> <term>meters</term>. Hint: you can check the answer to this part by evaluating on your calculator.

				<li>
							<p>
				A dust particle weighs approximately <m>\mathbf{7.53 \times 10^{-10}}</m> <term>grams</term>.
			</p>

				<em>Story also appears in 1.5 #2</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				A proton (part of an atom) has mass of about <m>\mathbf{1.67262 \times 10^{-27}}</m> <term>kilograms</term>.

				<em>Story also appears in 1.5 #7</em>

				<li>
							<p>
				In each story, evaluate the number and report your answer in scientific notation.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Bunnies, bunnies, everywhere. In 2007 there were 1800 and that number was predicted to increase 13% each year. I was trying to predict the number of rabbits in 2023 (after 16 years) but I accidentally typed in 166 years by mistake <me>1800 \ast 1.13 \wedge 166=</me> Report the answer I got in scientific notation. (Yes, this is a gigantic number. The exponential model I used doesn’t actually make sense for that many years.)
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Story also appears in 2.1 #2 and 5.1 #3</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. We can calculate the signal strength after 1000 miles by evaluating <me>.98 \wedge 1000=</me> Report the answer you get in scientific notation. (Yes, this is a teeny number. In reality there would be signal booster installed along the route.)

				<em>Story also appears in 5.2 #1</em>
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In each story, write out the highlighted number (with all the 0s). Note that <term>million</term> is short for <m>\times 10^6</m>, <term>billion</term> is short for <m>\times 10^9</m>, and <term>trillion</term> is short for <m>\times 10^{12}</m>.

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				There are approximately <term>1.084 million quarters</term> in circulation in the United States. <em>Story also appears in 0.1 #4</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The population of the world is approximately <term>8.1 billion people</term>.

				<em>Story also appears in 0.3 #1</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				One way that the United States government borrow money is Treasury bonds (T-bonds). There are approximately <term>$24 trillion</term> worth of T-bonds currently.

				<term>When you’re done …</term>
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Check your solutions. Still confused? Work with a classmate, instructor, or tutor.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Try the <term>Do you know</term> questions. Not sure? Read the textbook and try again.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Make a list of key ideas and process to remember under <term>Don’t forget!</term>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Do the textbook exercises and check your answers. Not sure if you are close enough? Compare answers with a classmate or ask your instructor or tutor.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Getting the wrong answers or stuck? Re-read the section and try again. If you are still stuck, work with a classmate or go to your instructor’s office hours or tutor hours.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.

			</ul></p>

			<p>
				<term>Do you know …</term>
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				What million, billion, and trillion mean?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Why scientific notation is used?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The standard format for scientific notation?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				That a positive exponent corresponds to a big number and a negative exponent corresponds to a tiny number?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				How to convert from scientific notation to decimal?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				How your calculator reports numbers in scientific notation, and what (might be) different when you’re reporting that number?
