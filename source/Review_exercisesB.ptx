Or you can order the same jerseys online for $18 each plus $2.35 per letter, but it costs another $4.95 for shipping per jersey. If we write <m>L</m> for the number of letters on the jersey and <m>T</m> for the total cost (in $), then those equations are

			For their holiday party at the office, Adriana had a tray of 200 empanadas delivered for $196. They were so good that she had a tray of 72 empanadas delivered to bring to her sister’s house on Christmas Eve, which cost $78.24.
