		<exercise xml:id="temperature-intercepts">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In each of the following stories, the temperature changes over time. It might be confusing to call either variable <m>T</m>, so use <m>H</m> for the time in hours and <m>D</m> for the temperature in degrees (°F). In each case, time should be measured from the start of the story.

				<introduction>

						It was really cold at 8:30 this morning when Raina arrived at the office. Luckily the heating system warms things up very quickly, 4°F per hour. By 11:00 a.m. it was a very comfortable 72°F.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						While 72°F is a perfectly good temperature for an office, not so for ballroom dancing. When Raina arrived for her practice at 5:30 that evening, she began to sweat before she even took the floor. Turns out the air conditioner had been running since 4:00 p.m. but it only cools down the room 3°F per hour.

	<exercise xml:id="beach-erosion-intercepts" component="not-workbook">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The public beach near Paloma's house has lost about 3<prime/>9<dblprime/> feet a year of beach depth (measured from the dunes to the high water mark) due to erosion since they started keeping records 60 years ago. Currently it's 210 feet deep.

				<p>
					The county is considering filling in sand to offset the erosion, back to the historical mark (60 years ago). How deep was it then? Notice that you need to convert 3<prime/>9<dblprime/> to (decimal) feet first.
