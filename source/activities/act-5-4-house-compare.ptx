            My parents bought the house I grew up in for $35,000 and sold it 40 years later for $342,000. Let's compare the linear model and the exponential model we have found for the value of the house.
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Draw a graph of the linear model you made in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-linear" text="type-global"/> and the exponential model you made in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-exp" text="type-global"/>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Using the variables you named in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-setup" text="type-global"/>, write an exponential equation showing how the value of the house increased.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    According to the <alert>linear</alert> model, when did the house reach a value of $200,000? Estimate from your graph, and then set up and solve an equation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    According to the <alert>exponential</alert> model, when did the house reach a value of $200,000? Estimate from your graph, and then set up and solve an equation.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Which model do you think is more realistic, and why? (No wrong answers!)
