    <ol marker="(a)">
        <li>
            <p>
                Write down a sentence or two in everyday language describing what units are.

            <p>
                Why is it true that <m>1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}</m>?
            </p>

                Use your explanation in part (c) to explain why
                <me>
                    \dfrac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ hour}} = 1.
                </me>
