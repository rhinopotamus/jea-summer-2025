        <p>
            A high-jumper jumps so that the height, <m>H</m> feet, of the point on his back that must clear the bar after <m>T</m> seconds is given by the equation <me>H = 3.5 + 16T -16T^2</me>.
        </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Rearrange the equation so that the <m>T^2</m> is first, the <m>T</m> is second, and the constant is last. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Use the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/> to find <em>exactly</em> when the high-jumper would hit the ground.

                    Does your answer make sense according to your work in <xref ref="act-3-5-highjump-approx" text="type-global"/>? If not, check your work.
