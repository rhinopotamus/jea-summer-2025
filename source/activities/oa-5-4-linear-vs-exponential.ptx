            Let's think about some of the properties of linear models and exponential models.
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    What are the constants in a <em>linear</em> model, and what do they mean in a story?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What are the constants in an <em>exponential</em> model, and what do they mean in a story?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    How does the shape of the graph of a <em>linear</em> model compare to the shape of a graph of an <em>exponential</em> model?
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What other differences do you see between these two kinds of equations?
