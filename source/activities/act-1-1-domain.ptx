            Here are the same stories one more time. Decide a reasonable domain for each variable and explain why your values are reasonable.

                        You're filling up a rectangular fish tank that is 4 feet long by 2 feet wide by 3 feet high; as time goes on, the water level gets higher.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What do you think is a reasonable domain for the time since I turned on the hose? Why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What do you think is a reasonable domain for the current water level? Why?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        You're putting a bunch of bricks in a wheelbarrow; the more bricks you add, the heavier the wheelbarrow is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What do you think is a reasonable domain for the weight of the wheelbarrow? Why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What do you think is a reasonable domain for the number of bricks in the wheelbarrow? Why?
                    </p>
