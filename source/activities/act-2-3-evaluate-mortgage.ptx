            Dontrell and Kim borrowed money to buy a house on a 30-year mortgage. After <m>T</m> months of making payments, Dontrell and Kim will still owe $<m>D</m> where 
            <me>D=236{,}000-56{,}000 \ast 1.004^T</me> 
            <m>D</m> is also known as the <term>payoff</term> <mdash/> how much they would need to pay to settle the debt.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if we evaluate at <m>T = 2</m>,
            <me>
                D = 236{,}000-56{,}000 \ast 1.004^2 \approx $179{,}550
            </me>
            This means that after 2 months of making payments, Dontrell and Kim still owe about $179,550. (Notice that's not how much they've paid so far!)
