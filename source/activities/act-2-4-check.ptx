            It's good practice to check that when you evaluate, and then round appropriately, you get the same numbers we've written down in the textbook. Remember, our equation is 
            <me>
                P = 1.049 \ast 1.0072^Y
            </me>

                <p>
                    Evaluate at <m>Y = 20</m> and check that you get <m>P = 1.626</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Evaluate at <m>Y = 15</m> and check that you get <m>P = 1.569</m>.

                <p>
                    Evaluate at <m>Y = 18</m> and check that you get <m>P = 1.603</m>.
                </p>

                    Evaluate at <m>Y = 17</m> and check that you get <m>P = 1.591</m>.
