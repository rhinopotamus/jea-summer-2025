            My parents bought the house I grew up in for $35,000 and sold it 40 years later for $342,000. Let's find an <alert>exponential</alert> model for the value of the house.
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use the information in the table you made in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-setup" text="type-global"/> to calculate the <xref ref="growth-factor-formula" text="custom">annual growth factor</xref>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Using the variables you named in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-setup" text="type-global"/>, write an exponential equation showing how the value of the house increased.
