        <p>
            A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Set up and solve an equation to find the half-life (or should we say <q>half-distance</q>?) of the signal. That means, how far can the signal travel without dropping below a strength of 0.5? 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Check your answer on the graph you drew in <xref ref="act-5-2-signal-roc-graph" text="type-global"/>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            (By the way, this wouldn't actually happen, because we would boost the signal once it got below 0.75.)
