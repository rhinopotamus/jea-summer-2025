            Kiran would really like to buy a new hybrid car that sells for $23,500. Sadly Kiran's credit rating is not very good, so the best the dealership offers is a loan at (you guessed it) 7% interest compouned monthly. Use the <xref ref="loan-payment-formula" text="title"/> to calculate her monthly car payments on a six year loan.

                    Plug everything in and evaluate to find Kiran's monthly payment.
