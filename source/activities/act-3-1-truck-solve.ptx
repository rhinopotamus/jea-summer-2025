            The equation for the total weight of the truck carrying bags of grass seed is
            <me>
                W = 3{,}900 + 4.2B
            </me>
            We are interested in finding how many bags the truck is carrying if its total weight is 14,500 pounds.

                <p>
                    Is the number 14,500 a value of <m>B</m> or a value of <m>W</m>? (Hint: Think about the units.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Replace the correct letter in the equation <m>W = 3{,}900 + 4.2B</m> by 14,500.
                </p>

                    In previous activities in this chapter, you evaluated this equation at many different values of <m>B</m>. What steps do you do, in what order, to evaluate the equation?

                    Check: Is your answer for the number of bags close to the approximate answer you found in <xref ref="act-3-1-truck-approx" text="type-global"/>?
