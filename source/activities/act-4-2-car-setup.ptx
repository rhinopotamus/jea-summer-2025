            Madison wants to buy a new car, either Car A: a hybrid priced at $26,100, or Car B: a high-efficiency gas car priced at $23,700. Annual fuel costs for Car A are currently $1,100 per year. For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $1,800 per year. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.
