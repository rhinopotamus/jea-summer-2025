            A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)

        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    The signal will need a <term>booster</term> (something to make the signal stronger again) when it has fallen to under 0.75 units.
                    Use successive approximation to find <em>approximately</em> how far along the cable the booster should be placed.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Now set up and solve an equation to find <em>exactly</em> how far along the cable the booster should be placed.
