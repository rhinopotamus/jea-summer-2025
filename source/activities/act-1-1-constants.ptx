            Let's take a real close look at the fish tank story and identify some constants. Reminder of the story: You're filling up a rectangular fish tank that is 4 feet long by 2 feet wide by 3 feet high; as time goes on, the water level gets higher.

                        What does the number 4 mean in the story? Does it ever change?
                    </p>

                        What does the number 2 mean in the story? Does it ever change?
                    </p>

                        What does the number 3 mean in the story? Does it ever change?
                    </p>
                </li>

                        How is the number 3 in the story different from the <em>variable</em> that describes the current water level?
