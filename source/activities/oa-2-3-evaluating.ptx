            In <xref ref="sec-2-2-First_look_exponential" text="type-global"/>, we looked at the equation
            <me>
                H = 2.26\ast 1.067^{Y}
            </me>
            that predicted health care costs, <m>H</m>, measured in trillions of dollars, as a function of <m>Y</m>, the number of years since 2007.
