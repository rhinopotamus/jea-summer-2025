        <p>
            A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)

        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Compute the <xref ref="rate-of-change" text="custom">rate of change</xref> of the signal strength between 0 and 2 miles.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Now compute the <xref ref="rate-of-change" text="custom">rate of change</xref> of the signal strength between 20 and 22 miles. How does this rate of change compare to the one you computed in part (a)?

            <li>
                <p>
                    Draw a graph of the signal strength function. How does the shape of the graph explain your findings?
