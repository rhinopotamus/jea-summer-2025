            The comprehensive fee at a local private college is $64,000. The fee is projected to increase by 5.8% per year. Let's test that the two-step method and the one-step method give the same result for the fee next year.

                    First, let's try this calculation the two-step way.
                    <ol marker="i.">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Convert 5.8% into decimal form.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Find the amount of this year's increase by multiplying 5.8% in decimal by this year's fee.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Add the amount of increase to this year's fee to find next year's fee.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Now let's try it the one-step way.
                    <ol marker="i.">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Explain why the new fee should be 105.8% of the old fee.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Write 105.8% in decimal form.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Find the new fee by multiplying 105.8% in decimal by this year's fee.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Did you get the same answer both ways? If not, check your work.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Which way do you prefer? Why?
