                        You're thinking about buying an <em>even larger</em> cake so you can invite <em>even more</em> people to your party. How much more expensive is it to buy a cake for 50 people than it is to buy a cake for 20 people?

                </li>

                        How many more people can you serve cake to?

                        How much more expensive is it <em>per person</em>?
