            Madison wants to buy a new car, either Car A: a hybrid priced at $26,100, or Car B: a high-efficiency gas car priced at $23,700. Annual fuel costs for Car A are currently $1,100 per year. For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $1,800 per year. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.

                    Find the difference between the two fuel costs, including units. (Don't forget <q>per year</q>!) Write a sentence explaining what your calculation means about the two cars.

                    Multiply by the number of years (which is a variable you named earlier!) to cancel out the <q>per year.</q> Write a sentence explaining what your calculation means about the two cars.

                    Would it make sense to compute <m>26{,}100 - 1{,}800</m>? Why or why not?
