            After his first beer, Stephen's blood alcohol content (BAC) was already 0.04 and as he continued to drink, his BAC level rose 45% per hour. The equation is 
            <me>S = 0.04 \ast 1.45^T</me> 
            where <m>S</m> is Stephen's BAC and <m>T</m> is the time, measured in hours.
            Let's think about the evaluating steps in this equation.
