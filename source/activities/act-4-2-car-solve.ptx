            Back to Madison's car shopping: Madison wants to buy a new car, either Car A: a hybrid priced at $26,100, or Car B: a high-efficiency gas car priced at $23,700. Annual fuel costs for Car A are currently $1,100 per year. For Car B annual fuel costs are currently $1,800 per year. The total cost of each car will depend on how many years she keeps it.

                    Madison wants to find the number of years where 
                    <me>
                        \text{total cost (for Car A)} = \text{total cost (for Car B)} 
                    </me>
                    Use your equations for the total cost for each car to turn this into an equation involving the number of years she keeps the car.

                    Follow the same steps Quia Xun did to determine the <term>payoff time</term>, or the number of years for which the total costs of each car are equal.
