        <p>
            A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)

            <li>
                <p>
                    What is the decay rate <m>r</m>? (Hint: your answer should be negative.)

                    What is the decay factor <m>g</m>? (Hint: your answer should be a little less than 100%, or a little less than 1 in decimal form.)
