            Here's a table of data about the comprehensive fee for the private college again. Fill in your own letter names for the variables.

            In <xref ref="act-1-2-choose-scale" text="type-global"/> we chose good scales for both axes; now we'll use the scales we chose to plot the points in the table. Here's the sample graph paper again:

        <image source='GraphPaper.jpg' width="90%" />
        <p>
            <ol marker="(a)">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with the point where the time is 4 years and the comprehensive fee is $80,200. Find where 4 years is located on your horizontal axis, and find where $80,200 is located on your vertical axis. Draw a point where those two locations meet.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Draw all the rest of the points given in the table. Don't forget the one where the time is 0 years and the comprehensive fee is $64,000!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Draw in a nice smooth curve connecting all the points.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the curve you drew to guess what the comprehensive fee will be in 7 years.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        What do you think the water level might be after 15 years?
