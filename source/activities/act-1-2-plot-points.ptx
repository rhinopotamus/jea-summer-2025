            Here's a table of data about the filling fish tank again. Fill in your own letter names for the variables.

            In <xref ref="act-1-2-choose-scale" text="type-global"/> we chose good scales for both axes; now we'll use the scales we chose to plot the points in the table. Here's the sample graph paper again:

            <ol marker="(a)">
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Let's start with the point where the time is 4 minutes and the water level is 14 inches. Find where 4 minutes is located on your horizontal axis, and find where 14 inches is located on your vertical axis. Draw a point where those two locations meet.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Draw all the rest of the points given in the table. Don't forget the one where the time is 0 minutes and the water level is 0 inches!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Draw in a nice smooth curve connecting all the points.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Use the curve you drew to guess what the water level was after 10 minutes.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        What do you think the water level might be after 20 minutes?
