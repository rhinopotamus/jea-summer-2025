            Before we do anything fancy, just thinking about the situation, let's make some bad guesses.
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Come up with a hilariously <em>low</em> guess: a year where the population of India is definitely <em>under</em> 1.6 billion.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Now come up with a hilariously <em>high</em> guess: a year where population of India is definitely <em>over</em> 1.6 billion.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Now that we've made some hilariously bad guesses, we can use them to come up with a better guess. The real year is somewhere in between your hilariously low guess and your hilariously high guess. What do you think is a more <em>reasonable</em> guess?
