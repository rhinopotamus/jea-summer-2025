            Percents are always <em>of</em> something <mdash/> they are a part of some <em>whole</em>. For example, in <xref ref="ss-1-1-percents" text="custom">a previous section</xref>, a report said that the average price of gasoline in Minnesota increased approximately 20% per year. If we were being very careful, we would say that this is 20% <em>of the current price</em> each year.

            For each of the percentages listed below, write a few words describing what the whole whould be.

                    In a recent game against the Golden State Valkyries, Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier's field goal percentage was 72.7%. This means that she made 72.7% of <fillin characters="10" />.

            The moral of this story: Any time you see some percentage, like 68%, you should ask, <q>68% <em>of what?</em></q>
