            Here are Sweet Rose Bakery's cake prices again. This time, let's draw a graph of these prices.

                        The number of servings should be on the horizontal axis, because it's the independent variable. Figure out a good scale for this axis.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The cost of the cake should be on the vertical axis, because it's the dependent variable. Figure out a good scale for this axis.
                    </p>
                </li>

                        Plot the points from the table on your graph, and connect them with a nice smooth curve.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>

                        What connections do you notice between the rates of change you computed in <xref ref="act-1-3-roc-8-15"/> and <xref ref="act-1-3-roc-15-40"/> and the steepness of the curve you just drew?
                    </p>

            </ol>
