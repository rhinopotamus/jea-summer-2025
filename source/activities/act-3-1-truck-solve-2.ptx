            The equation for the total weight of the truck carrying bags of grass seed is
            <me>
                W = 3{,}900 + 4.2B
            </me>
            Let's find the number of bags for a different weight.

                    Very heavy things (like trucks) are often weighed in <term>tons</term> rather than pounds. Use the fact that 1 ton = 2,000 pounds to convert 8 tons to pounds.

                    Set up and solve an equation to find the number of bags of grass seed being carried by the truck if its total weight is 8 tons. Remember, <q>set up and solve an equation</q> means to use the <xref ref="assemblage-shoes-and-socks" text="title"/>.
