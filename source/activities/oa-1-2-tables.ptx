        In <xref ref="subsec-percents" text="custom">the previous section</xref>, a report said that the average price of gasoline in Minnesota was $2.900/gal in 2010 and increased approximately 20% per year for the next several years. We calculated a few gas prices, which we'll now organize in a table.
