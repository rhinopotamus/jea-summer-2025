            Sweet Rose Bakery sells cakes (and cupcakes). Here are their prices, which depend on how many people you want to serve cake to.

                        You're thinking about buying a larger cake so you can invite more people to your party. How much more expensive is it to buy a cake for 15 people than it is to buy a cake for 8 people?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many more people can you serve cake to?

                    <p>
                        How much more expensive is it <em>per person</em>?
