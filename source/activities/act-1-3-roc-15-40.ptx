                        You're thinking about buying an <em>even larger</em> cake so you can invite <em>even more</em> people to your party. How much more expensive is it to buy a cake for 40 people than it is to buy a cake for 15 people?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many more people can you serve cake to?

                    <p>
                        How much more expensive is it <em>per person</em>?
