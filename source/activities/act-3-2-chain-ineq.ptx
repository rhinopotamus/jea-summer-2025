            The grass seed shipping company doesn't like to send out their trucks with too few bags of grass, because that's inefficient.
        </p>
        <ol marker="(a)">
            <li>
                <p>
                    Write an inequality saying that the weight of the truck should be at least 8,000 pounds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Write an inequality about the weight limit: the weight of the truck should be below 18,000 pounds.
                </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine these two inequalities into a chain of inequalities:
                    <me>
                        <fillin characters="2" /> \leq W \leq <fillin characters="2" />
                    </me>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Use the equation <m>W = 3{,}900 + 4.2B</m> to replace <m>W</m> in the chain of inequalities.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Solve the chain of inequalities by doing the <xref ref="assemblage-shoes-and-socks" text="title"/> to all three sides.
                </p>
