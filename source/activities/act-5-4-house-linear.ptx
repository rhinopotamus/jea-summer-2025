            My parents bought the house I grew up in for $35,000 and sold it 40 years later for $342,000. Let's find a <alert>linear</alert> model for the value of the house.
        </p>

            <li>
                <p>
                    Calculate the slope between the two points in the table you made in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-setup" text="type-global"/> using the <xref ref="rate-of-change" text="title"/>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Using the variables you named in <xref ref="act-5-4-house-setup" text="type-global"/>, write a linear equation showing how the value of the house increased.
