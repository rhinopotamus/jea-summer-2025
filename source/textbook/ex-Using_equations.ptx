			<p>
				Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10'<m>\times</m>25' vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. (Remember ' stands for <q>feet,</q> so the garden is 10 feet wide and 25 feet long.) One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.

		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose for the moment that the path will be 4 feet wide. Calculate the area of the path. Here's one way to do it: first, find the area of the outer rectangle, then subtract the area of the garden itself.

					Actually, they aren't sure how wide the path should be and how much gravel they can get. Let's write <m>W</m> = width of path (feet) and <m>G</m> = amount of gravel (cubic feet).

				Wynter has a pretty decent job. He is paid a salary of $780 per week but his hours vary week-to-week. Even though Wynter is not paid by the hour, he can figure out what his hourly wage would be depending on the number of hours he works. For example, in a week where Wynter works 40 hours, he's earning the equivalent of $19.50/hr because <me>\frac{\$780}{40 \text{ hours}} = 780 \div 40 =\$19.50\text{/hour}</me>
