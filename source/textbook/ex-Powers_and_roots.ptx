                    Jody is using small wooden balls to make noses for her knitted gnomes. She figured out that she can calculate the weight of each ball (in ounces) as <m>0.2 \times B \land 3</m> where <m>B</m> is the diameter of the ball (in inches). <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="wooden-balls-algebraic-notation"/>)</em>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    The size of a round pizza is described by its diameter. It turns out that we can calculate how many people are served by a pizza of diameter <m>D</m> inches as <m>0.015625 \times D \land 2=</m>. For example, a 16-inch diameter pizza serves <m>0.015625 \times 16 \land 2 = 4</m> people. (The mysterious number 0.015625 comes from a little geometry and pizza science.)

                Remember Noah's mom from our story? She was making a glass box that is <m>n \times n \times n</m> where the length <m>n</m> is measured in inches.

                Saboor is working on a needlepoint that will be a 1 foot by 1 foot square. The mesh grid comes in different sizes. For example, a 13-count mesh has 13 holes per inch which is <m>13 \times 12 =  156</m> holes per foot. If she uses a 13-count mesh, then the piece will have <m>156 \times 156 = 156 \land 2 = 24,336</m> holes.
