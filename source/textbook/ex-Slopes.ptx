					The local ski resort is trying to set the price for season passes. They know from past experience that they will sell around 14,000 passes if the season ticket price is $380. If the price is $400, they will sell fewer, perhaps only 11,000 passes. You can assume this decrease in demand is linear.

	<exercise xml:id="paper-slopes" component="not-workbook">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				I just saw an advertisement for the same paper we use at the office for only $4.25 per ream at a supply store. (Ream? Yes. That's 500 sheets of paper, usually wrapped in paper.) Is that a good deal?
			</p>
		</introduction>	
		<task>

					There are 10 reams in a case. What is the advertised price come to per case?

			</statement>
		</task>
		
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					I'm not sure I want to go get a case of paper myself because a case of paper is pretty heavy to lift. Paper is sold by the weight. Thick, heavier paper is considered fancier than lighter paper. The office uses a multipurpose paper called <q>92</q> meaning it weighs 92 grams per square meter which comes out to around 5 grams per sheet. How much does a case weigh? Use <m>1 \text{ kilogram} \approx 2.2 \text{ pounds}</m>.

		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					But, at the office we pay a delivery charge. Compare the cost of having just one case delivered versus my buying one case at the store. Recall that the office pays $15 delivery fee and $39.99 per case.

			</statement>
		</task>
		
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Write new equation for paper cost assuming I pick it up at the store. Use <m>N</m> for the number of cases of paper and <m>C</m> is the total cost, in dollars. <em>Hint: this equation is a direct proportionality.</em>

		<task>
