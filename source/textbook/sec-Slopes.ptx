			Last week our supplier delivered 13 cases of paper for the office and charged us $534.87. This week, they delivered 20 cases of paper for $814.80. We assume that their charge includes a fixed delivery fee and per case cost, so the dependence must be linear. We would like to understand their pricing scheme better by writing the equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			What to do? We can name the variables and put the information we are given into a table. That's a start. The variables must be
		</p>


		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>C=</m> total charge ($) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
			</row>
			<row left="minor" class="even">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>N =</m> number of cases delivered (cases) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

		<p>
			and we know
		</p>


		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>N</m></cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">13</cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">20</cell>
			</row>
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>C</m></cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">534.87</cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">814.80</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

		<p>
			Let's see. The fixed delivery fee that we don't know is the intercept. The per case cost that we also don't know is the slope. To write the linear equation we need to know both.
		</p>

		<p>
			The slope is just the rate of change, so we can figure out the slope just from the information in our table. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$814.80-\$534.87}{20-13 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{\$279.93}{7 \text{ cases}} = 279.93 \div 7 = \$39.99 \text{ per case}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			or, all at once, as <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$814.80-\$534.87}{20-13 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; (814.80-534.87)\div(20-13)= \$39.99 \text{ per case}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Either way, each case costs $39.99 and the slope is $39.99 per case.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now that we know the slope, we can find the intercept. At $39.99 per case we would expect 13 cases to cost <me>13 \text{ cases } \ast \frac{\$39.99}{\text{case}} = 13 \times 39.99 = \$519.87</me> But the story tells us 13 cases cost $534.87. The difference <m>\$534.87 - \$519.87 = \$15</m> must be the delivery fee which is the intercept. Remember <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}= 534.87 - 39.99\times 13= \$15</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Why did we use 13 cases? No good reason. Look what happens if we use 20 cases at $814.80 instead. <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}= 814.80 - 39.99\times 20= \$15</me> Yup. Still $15 delivery fee.
		</p>

		<p>
			The equation is linear so it fits our template <me>\text{dep} = \text{start} + \text{slope} * \text{indep}</me> and now that we know the slope and intercept, we can put those in to get our equation. <me>C = 15 + 39.99N</me> Let's check. When <m>N = 13</m> we get <me>C=15 + 39.99 \ast 13 = 15 + 39.99 \times \underline{13} = \$534.87 \quad \checkmark</me> and when <m>N=20</m> we get <me>C=15 + 39.99 \ast 20 = 15 + 39.99 \times \underline{20} = \$814.80 \quad \checkmark</me> You can also check that the graph goes through the original two points we were given. The intercept is $15, but because of the scale it shows up as barely above $0 on our graph.

		<p>
			The supplier also picks up recyclable paper and boxes. The normally charge $18 per pickup but under a new reuse incentive program, they discount a little for each box that's in good enough condition to use again. This week's recycling charge was only $7.60 because we returned the previous 13 boxes all in good shape.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now we're interested in how the recycling charge depends on the number of boxes in good condition that we return. The new variables are
		</p>


		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>R=</m> recycling charge ($) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
			</row>
			<row left="minor" class="even">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>B =</m> number of boxes returned (boxes) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

		<p>
			and we know
		</p>


		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>B</m></cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">0</cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">13</cell>
			</row>
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>R</m></cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">18</cell>
				<cell right="minor" halign="center">7.60</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

		<p>
			See how we used <m>B=0</m> for the situation where no boxes are returned? Clever.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can draw the graph using just these two points. (But we'll check later, once we have the equation, to be sure.)
		</p>


		<p>
			<image source='recyclepaper.png'/>
		</p>

		<p>
			Since there is a fixed discount per box, we again have a linear function. We know the intercept is the normal recycling fee of $18. We need to find the slope. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$7.60-\$18}{13-0 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; (7.60-18)\div(13-0)= -\$0.80 \text{ per box}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			It might look funny to get a negative, but it's to be expected. They are subtracting for each good box returned. The discount is 80 per box and so the equation is <me>R = 18 - 0.8B</me> Check when <m>B=13</m> we have <me>R = 18 -0.8*13 = 18-0.8 \times \underline{13} = \$7.60 \quad \checkmark</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			What's the most boxes you could get credit for? Probably the most they discount is the full $18, which would mean that <m>R=0</m>. That means we want to solve <m>18 -0.8B = 0</m>. Check that we get <m>B = 22.5 \text{ boxes}</m>, which means that 22 boxes would be almost $0 and for 23 boxes, they should pick up for free. We can check that 22 boxes gives <me>R = 18-0.8\ast22=18-0.8 \times \underline{22} = \$0.80</me> and 23 boxes gives <me>R = 18-0.8\ast23=18-0.8 \times \underline{23} = -\$0.80 \implies \text{free}</me> Well, unless they're nice and give us cash back.

								I just saw an advertisement for the same paper we use at the office for only $4.25 per ream at a supply store. (Ream? Yes. That's 500 sheets of paper, usually wrapped in paper.) Is that a good deal?
							</p>
				
							<p><ol>
								<li>
											<p>
												There are 10 reams in a case. What is the advertised price come to per case?
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												I'm not sure I want to go get a case of paper myself because a case of paper is pretty heavy to lift. Paper is sold by the weight. Thick, heavier paper is considered fancier than lighter paper. The office uses a multipurpose paper called <q>92</q> meaning it weighs 92 grams per square meter which comes out to around 5 grams per sheet. How much does a case weigh? Use <m>1 \text{ kilogram} \approx 2.2 \text{ pounds}</m>.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												But, at the office we pay a delivery charge. Compare the cost of having just one case delivered versus my buying one case at the store. Recall that the office pays $15 delivery fee and $39.99 per case.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												Write new equation for paper cost assuming I pick it up at the store. Use <m>N</m> for the number of cases of paper and <m>C</m> is the total cost, in dollars. <em>Hint: this equation is a direct proportionality.</em>
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												Compare total cost if get 4 cases either delivered or from store. Repeat 13 cases. Recall that the equation for delivered paper is <m>C=15+39.99N</m>.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												Graph both functions together on the same axes.
											</p>
								</li>

											<p>
												Set up and solve inequality for when delivered is cheaper.

								Now that he is retired, Elmer gets a pension check from the Railroad Company each month. There's a set amount he gets each month but the company deducts a fixed percentage of whatever outside income he earns. Elmer works part-time at the local hardware store. In February he earned $444.10 at the hardware store and his pension check that month was $886.23. In March he worked much less, earning only $179.30 at the hardware store; his pension check that month was $912.71

												If Elmer doesn't work in April, how much will his pension check be?

												Write an equation showing how Elmer's pension check is affected by his income from the hardware store. Use <m>H</m> for his income from the hardware store and <m>P</m> for his pension check, both in dollars.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												Elmer would like to earn enough at the hardware store to make at least $ total per month. Using <m>T</m> for the total Elmer earns in a month (in dollars), write an equation for <m>T</m> as a function of <m>H</m>. <em>Hint: start with <m>T=H+P</m>, then use your equation for <m>P</m> from part (c) to write everything with <m>H</m> instead.</em>

												Now set up and solve an inequality to determine how much Elmer needs to earn at the hardware store to make at least $ total per month.
