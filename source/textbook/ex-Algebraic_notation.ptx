                    Since she has been pregnant, Zoe has gained the recommended <m>\sfrac{1}{2}</m> pound per week. She weighed 153 pounds at the start of her pregnancy. That means when she is <m>T</m> weeks pregnant, that Zoe weighs <me>153 + \frac{1}{2}T</me> What does this expression say Zoe will weigh when she's 40 weeks pregnant?
