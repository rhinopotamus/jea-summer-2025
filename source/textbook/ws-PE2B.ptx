		<introduction>
			<p>
				Xander grows tomatoes in his garden. He's noticed that a typical plant yields 5 pounds of tomatoes. He's been experimenting with the impact of liquid food on plant yield and estimates that each drop increases yield by 14%.

					Name the variables, including units and dependence.

			<statement>
				<p>
					Xander uses 10 drops of food on one of his tomato plans and uses all of the tomatoes from that plant to make salsa. If each pound of tomatoes makes around a pint of salsa, how much salsa will Xander have (from that one plant)?

	<exercise xml:id="t-shirt-printing-PE2B" workspace="1.5in">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Skye and her sister Clover started a t-shirt printing company. To produce a particular t-shirt it costs $350 in materials and labor to set up a silkscreen and then $7.50 for each shirt made to cover materials and printing. The average cost per t-shirt $<m>C</m> is a function of <m>N</m>, the number of t-shirts printed. The equation for this function is <me>C = \frac{350+7.50N}{N}</me>

					Evaluate this formula when <m>N=50</m>. What does the resulting value of <m>C</m> mean in the story?

					Make a table showing the average cost per t-shirt if Skye and Clover make 1, 20, 50, 100, or 300 t-shirts.
