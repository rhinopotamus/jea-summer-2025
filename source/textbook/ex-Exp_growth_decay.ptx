		<exercise xml:id="fiber-optic-growth-decay">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)
					<em>Story also appears in <xref ref="fiber-optic-prelude-scientific-notation"/></em>

		<exercise xml:id="heart-attack-growth-decay">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					If a person has a heart attack and their heart stops beating, the amount of time it takes paramedics to restart their heart with a defibrillator is critical. Each minute that passes decreases the person's chance of survival by 10%. Assume that this statement means the decrease is exponential and that the survival rate is 100% if the defibrillator is used immediately.
