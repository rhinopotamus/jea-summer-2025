								<p>
									What was her salary after the second raise?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Her colleague Tomás̆ started with a salary of $78,000 but did not get a raise the first year like Mai did. What percentage raise would Tomás̆ need now in order to have the same final salary as Mai?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Would Mai's salary have been the more than, less than, or the same as now if she had received the 1.5% raise first and then the 6% raise?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Which order would you rather have: 6% then 1.5% or 1.5% then 6%? Why?

						The number of school children in the district from a single parent household has been on the rise. In one district there were 1,290 children from single parent households in 2010 and that number was expected to increase about 3% per year.

						<li>
								<p>
									According to your equation, what would Um Archivo's earnings be in 2020.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									If Um Archivo reports earnings of $78.1 billion in 2020, would you say the projected rate of 17% was too high or too low? Explain.
