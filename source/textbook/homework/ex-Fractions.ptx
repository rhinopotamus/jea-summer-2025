            <introduction>
                <p>
                    There are 2,624 students at a local university.

                        The Dean said that approximately 1 in 4 students, or <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of all students, placed into algebra. Is that correct? Check by determining if your answer to part (a) <m>\approx \frac{1}{4}</m> by comparing decimal approximations.
