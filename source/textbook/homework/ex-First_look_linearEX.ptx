						Plumbers are really expensive, so I'm comparing their rates. Write an equation for each possibility, using the same variables as our example: <m>T</m> for the time the plumber takes (in hours) and <m>P</m> for the plumber's total charge (in dollars).

						The local burger restaurant had a promotion this summer. Typically a bacon double cheeseburger costs $7.16. They reduced the price by 2 for each degree in the daily high temperature. For example, if the high temperature was 80<m>^\circ</m>F, they would decrease the price by <m>0.02 \times 80 = \$1.60</m>, so the double cheeseburger would cost <m>7.16-1.60=\$5.56</m>. Mmmm. <em>Story also appears in 3.1 #4</em>

						A report on health care back in 1975 stated that the U.S. had around 1,466,000 hospital beds and since then the number of beds has declined by around 16,000 beds per year.

						The stretch of interstate highway through downtown averages 1,450 cars per hour during the morning rush hour. The economy is improving (finally), but with that the county manager predicts traffic levels with increase around 130 cars per hour more each week for the next couple of years. <em>Story also appears in 3.1 Exercises</em>
