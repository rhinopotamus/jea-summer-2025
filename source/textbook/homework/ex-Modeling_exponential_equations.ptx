		<exercise xml:id="flu-dorm-modeling-exponential" workspace="1.2in">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					A flu virus has been spreading through the college dormitories. Initially 8 students were diagnosed with the flu, but that number has been growing 16% per day. Earlier we found the equation <me>N=8 \ast1.16^T</me> where <m>T</m> is the time in days (since the first diagnosis) and <m>N</m> is the total number of students who had the flu. <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="flu-dorm-first-look-exponential"/> and 5.5 textbook)</em>

				<statement>

						There are 1,094 students currently living in the dorms. Suppose ultimately 250 students catch the flu. According to your equation, when would that happen? Show how to solve your equation.

				</statement>
			</task>
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It is not realistic to expect that everyone living in the dorms will catch the flu, but what does the equation say? Set up and solve an equation to find when all 1,094 students would have the flu. (Again, this is not realistic.)

		<exercise xml:id="greenhouse-co2-modeling-exponential" workspace="1.4in">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations are related to global climate change. In 1980, the carbon dioxide concentration was 338 ppm (parts per million). At that time it was assumed that carbon dioxide concentrations would increase 0.42% per year.

	<exercise xml:id="reality-tv-modeling-exponential">
		<statement>
