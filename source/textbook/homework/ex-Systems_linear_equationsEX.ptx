						Just when Quia Xun thought she had things figured out, another possible option emerged. She can outsource her lock production to a different plant at the cost of $1.55 per lock. While that's more expensive per lock, it avoids having to buy a machine at all. Recall her first two options were

						Don't ask why I know this, but it takes me 80 seconds per square foot to wash a floor using a rag. If I use a mop, it's slightly quicker at 75 seconds per square foot, but another 3 minutes at the end to wring out the mop. (The rag just pops in the washing machine.)

						Maria needed to replace the light bulb in the hallway. When she went to the home improvement store she was overwhelmed with the choices of light bulbs. One option is a compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulb. A CFL bulb costs $1. This fixture will cost $0.95 per month to run with a CFL bulb. A different option Maria is considering is a light-emitting diode (LED) instead of a bulb. A LED costs $24 but reduces the cost for the fixture to $0.60 per month.

						The community center offers exercise classes on a pay-as-you-go basis. It normally costs $20 to register and then $15 per exercise class. Alternatively, you can pay $150 to become a member, and then $10 per exercise class. If we let <m>E</m> represent the number of exercise classes I attend and <m>T</m> represent the total cost in dollars, then the equations are:

						A solar heating system costs approximately $30,000 to install and $150 per year to run. By comparison, a gas heating system costs approximately $12,000 to install and $700 per year to run. Earlier we wrote equations showing how the total cost $<m>T</m> depends on the time, <m>Y</m> years.

									How does the payback time change if the state offers a $7,000 rebate? That means, in effect, that the solar system costs $7,000 less to install. Write a new equation for the solar heating system. Then set up and solve the new system.
