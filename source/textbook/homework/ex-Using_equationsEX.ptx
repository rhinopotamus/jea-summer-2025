						The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe 4WD will take about 158.1 feet to stop when traveling at 60 mph in normal highway conditions. Let <m>S</m> be the speed at which the vehicle is traveling, in miles per hour (mph), and <m>D</m> the distance it takes to stop, in feet. This information together with a little physics gives the equation <me>D = 0.0439S^2 + 1.47S</me>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									According to this equation, how many feet does it take to stop the Tahoe when traveling 80 miles per hour?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									In driver's training classes they teach the <q>two-second rule</q> for safety: you should follow no closer than two seconds behind the car in front of you. If you are traveling 80 miles per hour, how many feet can you travel in two seconds? <em>Hint: convert to feet per second, then multiply by two seconds.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Compare your results from parts (a) and (b) to decide if the <q>two-second rule</q> is adequate for safety at 80 miles per hour. That is, if you are following two seconds behind the car in front of you and calamity strikes that car, will you be able to stop before hitting it?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Is the <q>two-second rule</q> adequate at 50 mph?
								</p>
						</li>

						Mom always said to sit close to the lamp when I was reading. The intensity of light <m>L</m>, measured in percentage (%) that you see from a lamp depends on your distance from the lamp, <m>F</m> feet as described by the formula <me>L=\frac{100}{F^2}</me> <em>Story also appears in 1.1 and 3.3 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Calculate the intensity when I sit 1 foot, 2 feet, or 3 feet away.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									The other day I was sitting 27 inches from the lamp. What was the intensity of the light there?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Calculate the rate of change of light intensity between 2 feet and 27 inches. What does that tell you in terms of the story?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Draw a graph illustrating the function.

						Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10'<m>\times</m>25' vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. (Remember ' stands for <q>feet,</q> so the garden is 10 feet wide and 25 feet long.) One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.

						<em>Story also appears in 2.4 Exercises and 3.5 #4</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									The other measurements are in feet, so convert the depth of the path (3 inches) into feet also.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Suppose for the moment that the path will be 4 feet wide. Calculate the area of the path. Here's one way to do it: first, find the area of the outer rectangle, then subtract the area of the garden itself.
								</p>
						
								<p>
									<em>Hint: the length of that outer rectangle includes the 25 feet of garden plus the width of the path on each side. Same for the width of that outer rectangle.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Figure out how much gravel they would need (in cubic feet) for a 4 foot wide path by multiplying your answers to (a) and (b).
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Actually, they aren't sure how wide the path should be and how much gravel they can get. Let's write <m>W</m> = width of path (feet) and <m>G</m> = amount of gravel (cubic feet). It turns out that <me>G = W^2 + 17.5W</me> Check that when you evaluate at <m>W=4</m> you get the same answer as in (c).
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									How many cubic feet of gravel would they need to make the path 2 feet wide? 3 feet wide? 42 inches?
								</p>
						</li>

						One measure of the diversity of our news source is the count of the number of different daily newspapers in circulation. A reasonable equation estimating this count over the past century is <me>N = -0.0021T^3+0.34T^2-20T+ 2,226</me> where <m>N</m> is the number of daily newspapers in circulation in the United States <m>T</m> years after 1900.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Based on this equation, how many daily newspapers were in circulation in 1920? In 1955? In 1995? In 2010?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									During which period were the number of newspapers in circulation dropping faster: 1900 to 1920 or 1995 to 2010?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Draw a graph illustrating the dependence.

						Mrs. Weber's cooking class came up with the equation <me>M = 1.2F^2+4F+7</me> to approximate the grilling time of a piece of fish depending on its thickness. Here <m>M</m> is the number of minutes to grill the fish and <m>F</m> is the thickness of the fish (in inches).
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<em>Story also appears in 1.1 and 3.5 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Evaluate the equation at <m>F=0.25, 1, 1.5,</m> and <m>2</m>.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What do the answers you found say about cooking fish?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Draw a graph showing how the cooking time depends on the thickness of the fish.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Your graph should show that the function is increasing. Explain how that makes sense in terms of the story.

						Wynter has a pretty decent job. He is paid a salary of $780 per week but his hours vary week-to-week. Even though Wynter is not paid by the hour, he can figure out what his hourly wage would be depending on the number of hours he works. For example, in a week where Wynter works 40 hours, he's earning the equivalent of $19.50/hr because <me>\frac{\$780}{40 \text{ hours}} = 780 \div 40 =\$19.50\text{/hour}</me>
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<em>Story also appears in 3.3 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									What's Wynter's equivalent hourly wage in a week when he works 50 hours? 60 hours?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
