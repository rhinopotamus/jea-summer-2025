						I just saw an advertisement for the same paper we use at the office for only $4.25 per ream at a supply store. (Ream? Yes. That's 500 sheets of paper, usually wrapped in paper.) Is that a good deal?
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									There are 10 reams in a case. What is the advertised price come to per case?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									I'm not sure I want to go get a case of paper myself because a case of paper is pretty heavy to lift. Paper is sold by the weight. Thick, heavier paper is considered fancier than lighter paper. The office uses a multipurpose paper called <q>92</q> meaning it weighs 92 grams per square meter which comes out to around 5 grams per sheet. How much does a case weigh? Use <m>1 \text{ kilogram} \approx 2.2 \text{ pounds}</m>.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									But, at the office we pay a delivery charge. Compare the cost of having just one case delivered versus my buying one case at the store. Recall that the office pays $15 delivery fee and $39.99 per case.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Write new equation for paper cost assuming I pick it up at the store. Use <m>N</m> for the number of cases of paper and <m>C</m> is the total cost, in dollars. <em>Hint: this equation is a direct proportionality.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Compare total cost if get 4 cases either delivered or from store. Repeat 13 cases. Recall that the equation for delivered paper is <m>C=15+39.99N</m>.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Graph both functions together on the same axes.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Set up and solve inequality for when delivered is cheaper.

						The amount of garbage generated in the United States has increased steadily, from 88.1 million tons in 1960 to 254.2 million tons in 2006.

					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Assume the amount of garbage increases linearly, by how much has garbage increased each year?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Name the variables, including units, and write a linear equation relating them.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									According to your equation, how much garbage was projected for 2010? For 2020?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									If this trend continues, when will the amount of garbage generated exceed 300 million tons? Show how to set up and solve an inequality to find the answer. Be sure to state the actual year.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									A 2010 report listed the amount of garbage at 249 million tons. Compare this information to your previous answer. What are some possible explanations for why this amount was less than expected (and actually decreased from 2006)?

						Now that he is retired, Elmer gets a pension check from the Railroad Company each month. There's a set amount he gets each month but the company deducts a fixed percentage of whatever outside income he earns. Elmer works part-time at the local hardware store. In February he earned $444.10 at the hardware store and his pension check that month was $886.23. In March he worked much less, earning only $179.30 at the hardware store; his pension check that month was $912.71
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									What percentage of his income from the hardware store is deducted from his pension check? <em>Calculate the fraction of a dollar deducted for each dollar earned. Convert your answer to percent.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									If Elmer doesn't work in April, how much will his pension check be?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Write an equation showing how Elmer's pension check is affected by his income from the hardware store. Use <m>H</m> for his income from the hardware store and <m>P</m> for his pension check, both in dollars.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Elmer would like to earn enough at the hardware store to make at least $1,200 total per month. Using <m>T</m> for the total Elmer earns in a month (in dollars), write an equation for <m>T</m> as a function of <m>H</m>. <em>Hint: start with <m>T=H+P</m>, then use your equation for <m>P</m> from part (c) to write everything with <m>H</m> instead.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Now set up and solve an inequality to determine how much Elmer needs to earn at the hardware store to make at least $1,200 total per month.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									If Elmer earns $8.15 per hour, how many hours does he need to work at the hardware store to make at least $1,200 total per month, accounting for his income from the hardware store and his pension check?
