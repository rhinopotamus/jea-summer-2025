						Claude is an excellent juggler. Remember that the height <m>H</m> feet of Claude's beanbag <m>T</m> seconds after he throws it in the air is described by the equation <m>H = 3+15T-16T^2</m>. Answer each of the following question by the suggested method and then look back at the graph from earlier to make sure your answers make sense.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Use the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/> to find when is the bean bag is 5 feet above ground? Why do both answers make sense in the story?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									When is the beanbag 8 feet above ground? Try to use the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/> to find the answer. What happens? Explain why it makes sense in the story that you can't solve this quadratic equation.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Claude decided that the beanbag was too high in the air, so he modified his throw slightly. Now the height is given by <m>H = 3+14T-16T^2</m>. What is the maximum height the beanbag will reach now? <em>Hint: what number can you evaluate at?</em>
								</p>

			<li>
					<p>
						The stopping distance for Jeff 's Cadillac Escalade is given by <me>D=0.04S^2+1.47S</me> where <m>S</m> is the speed of the car (in miles per hour) and <m>D</m> is the stopping distance (in feet). Jeff took 183 feet to stop. How fast was he going?
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<em>Story also appears in Section 2.3</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Use successive approximation to estimate the answer to the nearest miles per hour. Display your work in a table.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Show how to use the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/> to solve the equation.

						A company produces backpacks. The more they make, the less it costs for each one. The cost per backpack is given by the equation <me>C = 0.01B^2 -1.2B + 50</me> where <m>C=</m> cost per backpack ($ per backpack) and <m>B=</m> number of backpacks.
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<em>Story appears in 1.3 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									How many backpacks do they need to produce in order to hold costs to $20/backpack? Set up and solve a quadratic equation to find the answer.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Make a table of values and draw a graph of the function. Does your answer agree with your table and graph?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What is the minimum price per backpack? <em>Hint: evaluate at <m>T= \frac{-b}{2a}</m>.</em>

						Mrs. Weber's cooking class came up with the equation <me>M = 1.2F^2+4F+7</me> to approximate the grilling time of a piece of fish depending on its thickness. Here <m>M</m> is the number of minutes to grill the fish and <m>F</m> is the thickness of the fish in inches.
					</p>
			
					<p>
						<em>Story appears in 1.1 and 2.3 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									If we want to make sure the fish will cook in under 20 minutes, what thickness steak can we have? Set up and solve a quadratic equation to find the answer.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Repeat for 10 minutes.

					<p>
						A company who makes electronics was doing great business in 1996, but sales quickly slid after 2000. Their sales <m>M</m> in millions of $ <m>Y</m> years from 1996 is given by the following equation <me>M = 104.4+11.5Y-1.4Y^2</me> <em>Story appears in 2.4 Exercises</em>

									The company decided to declare bankruptcy when sales fell below $20 billion. In what year was that? Show how to solve using the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/>.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									An analyst had suggested that they close down shop earlier, once sales were below $50 billion. In what year did sales fall that low? Show how to solve using the <xref ref="quadratic-formula" text="title"/>.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What year did sales <term>peak</term> (reach their highest value)?

					<p>
						A kangaroo hops up in the air (and out) from a 10 foot cliff. Her height above the ground, <m>K</m> feet, after <m>T</m> seconds is given by the equation <me>K = 10 + 5.2T - 4.88T^2</me>
