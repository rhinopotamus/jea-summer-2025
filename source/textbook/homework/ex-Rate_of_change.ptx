	<exercise xml:id="backpacks-rate-of-change-tx">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				A company produces backpacks. The more they make, the less it costs for each one. For example, if they produce 10 backpack it would cost $39 each. For 40 backpacks, they would cost $18 each. By 70 backpacks, the unit cost is down to $15 each. At 100 backpacks, the unit cost is $30 each. <em>Story also appears in 3.5 Exercises</em>
