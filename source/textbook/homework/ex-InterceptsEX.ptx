						The public beach near Paloma's house has lost about 3'9" feet a year of beach depth (measured from the dunes to the high water mark) due to erosion since they started keeping records 60 years ago. Currently it's 210 feet deep.
					</p>

						<li>
								<p>
									The county is considering filling in sand to offset the erosion, back to the historical mark (60 years ago). How deep was it then? Notice that you need to convert 3'9" to (decimal) feet first.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Name the variables and write an equation relating them, assuming the county does not fill in the beach now. Measure time from 60 years ago.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									The country agrees to start filling in sand when the depth drops below 180 feet. How many (more) years will that take to happen? First estimate the answer using successive approximation. Then set up and solve an inequality to find the answer.
								</p>

									Draw a graph showing the sand erosion over the past 60 years and including the next 20 years, assuming the county does not do any filling.
