	<exercise xml:id="caffeine-growth-decay">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Joe's girlfriend Ceyda starts the day by downing two cans of Red Bull, containing a total of 160 mg of caffeine. Her body eliminates the caffeine at a slightly slower rate of 12% each hour.
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Name the variables and write an equation to model this situation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						What's the half-life of caffeine for Ceyda? Set up and solve an equation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Ceyda heard that drinking a glass of water an hour can help eliminate caffeine faster. If so, would the half-life be shorter or longer? Explain.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				The population of bacteria in a culture dish begins at 2,000 and will triple every day.

				<statement>
					<p>
						Write an equation illustrating bacterial growth.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>

					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Use your equation to extend your table to include 10 days, 20 days, and 30 days. Be careful to report the large numbers appropriately. <em>Hint: scientific notation</em>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						The dish can support around 1 million bacteria. When does that happen? Give your answer to the nearest hour.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Draw a graph, including a table of reasonable values. Remember, the dish can only support up to 1 million bacteria, so your graph should go up to 1 million.
					</p>
				</statement>

	<exercise xml:id="house-value-growth-decay">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Tenzin bought a house for $291,900 but the housing market collapsed and his house value dropped 4.1% each year.
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						At this rate, how many years would it take for the value of Tenzin's house to drop below $240,000? Use successive approximation to guess the year.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Now set up and solve an equation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
	</exercise>

	<exercise xml:id="wetlands-growth-decay">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				One modern technique for cleaning waste water involves the use of constructed (man-made) wetlands. Wetlands act as a natural biofilter for various contaminants in the waste water. After each month in the wetlands, only about of the contaminants remain in any given sample. Suppose a sample had 8 grams of contaminants before processed in the constructed wetlands.
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						How much would remain in the sample after 1 month? 2 months? 3 months?
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Your equation should fit the template for an exponential equation. What is the monthly decay factor?
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						According to your equation, when will the contaminants fall below 1 mg? 1 <m>\mu</m>g? Remember <m>1 \text{ gram} = \text{1,000 mg}</m> and <m>1 \text{ gram} = \text{1,000,000 } \mu \text{g}</m>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Draw a graph illustrating the waste water treatment process for the first 6 months.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>

	<exercise xml:id="hibbing-growth-decay">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Hibbing, Minnesota is the hometown of baseball star Roger Maris, basketball great Kevin McHale, the Greyhound Bus lines, the Hull-Rust-Mahoning Open Pit Iron Mine and, perhaps most famously, the childhood home of songwriter Bob Dylan. It is not a big town. In 2000 the population was reported at 17,071 residents, with an expected decrease of around 0.4% per year.
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						What is the annual decay factor?
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Based on these estimates, what was the anticipated population of Hibbing in 2010?
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						The actual 2010 U.S.Â Census estimate of Hibbing's population was 16,361 people. Was the decrease slower or faster than expected? Was the decay rate more or less than 0.4%? Explain.
					</p>
				</statement>

	<exercise xml:id="food-shelf-growth-decay">
		<introduction> 
			<p>
				Donations to a local food shelf have increased 35% over last year. There were 3,400 pounds of food donated last year. <em>Story also appears in 5.3 #4</em>
			</p>
		</introduction>	
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Name the variables, measuring time since last year. (Yes, it's a little awkward.)
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Write an exponential equation relating the variables, assuming the rate of increase continues.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						How much was donated this year? How much is expected next year? The year after?
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						At this rate, what is the doubling time? That means, how long would it be until twice as much is donated. Set up and solve an equation to answer. Report your answer to the nearest month.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</task>
			
			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						The agency estimates that around 12,000 pounds of food is needed each year to meet the needs of the people they serve. In how many years will donations reach that level? (In your answer, say how many years from now.)
