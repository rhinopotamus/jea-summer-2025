						The employee-paid cost of health insurance has risen dramatically, increasing by 7% each year since 2003 when it cost $420/month.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Name the variables and write an exponential equation relating them.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									If this rate of increase continues, when will or did the employee-paid cost pass $550/month? Solve your equation.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Repeat for $600/month.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Graph the function.

						The number of school children in the district from a single parent household has been on the rise. In one district there were 1,290 children from single parent households in 2010 and that number was expected to increase about 3% per year. Earlier, we found the equation was <me>C = 1,290\ast1.03^Y</me> where <m>C</m> is the number of children and <m>Y</m> is the years since 2010.

					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Use successive approximation to determine when there will be over 3,000 school children in the district from a single parent household. Display your work in a table. Round your answer to the nearest year.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Show how to solve the equation to calculate when there will be over 3,000 school children in the district from a single parent household. Show how you solve the equation.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Solve again to determine when there will be over 3,500 children. Check your answer.

						Suppose a special kind of window glass is 1 inch thick and lets through only 75% of the light. If we use <m>W</m> inches of window glass, it lets <m>L\%</m> of the light through where <me>L = 100\ast 0.75^W</me> <em>Story also appears in 2.4 and 5.3 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									What thickness glass should be used to let through less than 10% of the light? <em>Set up and solve an equation.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What about 50%? <em>Set up and solve an equation.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Check the graph (drawn before) to see if your answers make sense.

						We saw that poultry population was estimated to grow according to the equation <me>P = 78 \ast 1.016^Y</me> where <m>P</m> is the poultry population in million tons and <m>Y</m> is the years starting in 2005.

					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									When will production rise above 95 million tons? Set up and solve an equation. Then use some other method to check.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Repeat for 120 million tons.

						Darcy likes to use temporary hair color in wild colors. Good thing it washes out. Her best guess is that 8% of the color washes out each time she washes her hair. That means the percentage of color remaining, <m>C</m>, is a function of the number of times she washes her hair, <m>W</m>, according to the equation <me>C=100 \ast 0.92^W</me>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									When will half the color be gone? That means find <m>C=50\%</m>. Set up and solve an equation. Then check some other way.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									By the time only 10% of the color remains you really can't tell anymore if it was pink or orange or blue. So, she might as well switch to a new color then. How many washes before only 10% remains? Again, first solve. Then check.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Draw a graph showing how the color washes out of Darcy's hair.
