						Lue's family bought a house three years ago and owes $192,000 on their mortgage. In reality, their monthly payment will include taxes, insurance, and money for escrow but let's ignore those amounts for this problem. In each part of this problem, use the <xref href="loan-payment-formula" text="title"/>.

						<li>
								<p>
									They currently owe $192,000 on their mortgage for the remaining 27 years at 4.5% compounded monthly. Calculate their monthly payment.

									Lue's family can refinance at 3.5% compounded monthly on a 30-year mortgage loan. Rolling in closing costs, their new loan would be for $195,000. Calculate their monthly payment if they refinance.

									Or, they can refinance to a 15-year mortgage at 3.25% compounded monthly. With closing costs, their new loan would be again be for $195,000. Calculate their monthly payment if they refinance this way instead.
