		<introduction>
			<p>
				The GDP (gross domestic product) of the United States was approximately $15,596 billion in 2011 and the population of the United States was approximately 0.313 billion that year.

			</p>
		</introduction>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Writing the population as 0.313 billion seems strange. A more natural unit would be millions. Rewrite the population in millions of people.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Rewrite the population in people, both in normal decimal notation (that means with all the 0s) and in scientific notation.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					It also seems strange to write the GDP as $15,596 billion. A more natural unit would be <term>trillions</term>, where 1 trillion = 1,000,000,000,000. Rewrite the GDP in trillions of dollars.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Rewrite the GDP in dollars, both in normal decimal notation and in scientific notation.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Calculate the GDP <term>per capita</term> (meaning per person) by dividing the GDP in dollars by the population in people. Express your answer in $/person.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</task>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					For practice, repeat your calculation using the numbers in scientific notation.
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Because <m>\times</m> and <m>\div</m> are at the same level in the order of operations, you need to put parentheses around each number in scientific notation before dividing.</em>
