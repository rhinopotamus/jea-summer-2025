						We looked at the city's plan to increase the number of affordable apartments. From a current estimate of 64,100 apartments classified as <q>affordable,</q> they hoped to build 7,800 per year. At that rate, they can reach a total of 150,000 apartments in 12 years.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Things change. Revised estimates call for only 6,200 new apartments each year. At that rate, when will the city reach the 150,000 apartments goal? Using the same variables as in this section, set up and solve an equation.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									More bad news. The definition of <q>affordable</q> has changed again, so the new count shows only 48,700 apartments on the list. And still only 6,200 new apartments each year. Now when will the city reach the 150,000 apartments goal? Set up and solve an equation.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									In light of the new definition and, consequently, only 48,700 apartments currently on the list, the city has received additional funding to up the number of apartments built each year. They would like to return to their goal of having 150,000 affordable apartments in 12 years. How many apartments do they need to add each year to reach that goal? Figure out the answer however you like, but check that it works.

						At a local <term>state university</term>, the tuition each student pays is based on the number of credit hours that student takes plus fees. The university charges $870 per credit hour plus a $560 fee. The fee is paid once regardless of how many credits are taken.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Find the slope and intercept and explain what each means in terms of the story.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Make a table of values showing the tuition cost for 3 credits, 12 credits, or 16 credits.
								</p>

					<p>
						At the local <term>community college</term>, the tuition each student pays is based only on the number of credits. The college charges $415 per credit.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									Using the same variables as before, write an equation relating them for the community college.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Find the slope and intercept and explain what each means in terms of the story.

						<li>
								<p>
									Make a table of values showing the tuition cost for 3 credits, 12 credits, or 16 credits.

						<li>
								<p>
									Graph both functions on the same axes.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What do you notice about the graph that confirms the community college is always cheaper?
								</p>
						</li>
			
					</ol></p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
						Can you tell from the table which of these functions is linear? Use the rate of change to help you decide. Remember that numbers may have been rounded.
