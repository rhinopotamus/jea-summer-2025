						In our example in this section, we made several tables of values. Go back and check that they are correct.

						Mari volunteers answering calls for in the office of her local state government representative. The office has been receiving a lot of calls recently with about BPA, a chemical found in plastics. The callers want their representative to support a bill banning BPA. An equation that describes the number of total number of calls over time is the following: <me>C=\frac{837}{1+118\ast 0.8025^D}</me> where <m>D</m> is the time since January 1 (in days), and <m>C</m> is the total number of calls.
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									According to this equation, how many calls (total) will Mari's office get by February 1 (day 31), March 1 (day 59), April 1 (day 90), May 1 (day 120), and Nov 8 (day 311)?
								</p>
						</li>

								<p>
									During which months did most of the calls come in?

						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Draw a graph illustrating the function.

								<p>
									Describe what happened over time.

						Even though all the callers support the bill, Mari isn't sure whether the calls represent the local constituents. Perhaps only supporters are calling her office, for example. So, she asks her pollster, Paul, to add this question to the list for his daily survey. Based on that survey, Paul estimates the percentage <m>P</m> of local constituents who support the bill on day <m>D</m> by the equation <me>P =100 - 87.3 \ast 0.992^D</me>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									According to this equation, what percentage of callers supported the bill on January 1 (day 0), March 1 (day 59), Aug 1 (day 212), Oct 1 (day 273) and Nov 8 (day 311)?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									What does your equation say the percentage would be on day 500 (which probably isn't realistic in this problem)? How about day 1,000?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Use successive approximations to estimate when the percentage supporting the bill first reached majority (50%).

									Set up and solve an equation to find when the percentage supporting the bill first reached majority (50%).

						Infants are regularly checked to make sure they are growing accordingly. The World Health Organization publishes growth charts to evaluate infant weight <m>W</m> in kilograms at a given age <m>M</m> in months since birth. An equation that describes an average infant boy is the following: <me>W=15-11.5\ast0.932^M</me>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									According to this equation, what is the average infant boy weight at birth, 1 month, 4 months, and a year?
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Convert your answers to pounds and ounces using <me>1 \text{ kilogram } \approx 2.2 \text{ pounds} \quad \text{ and } \quad 1 \text{ pound } = 16 \text{ ounces}</me> <em>Hint: first convert to pounds. Then convert just the decimal part to ounces.</em>
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									The equation is valid for <m>0 \le M \le 36</m>, or up to three years old. Draw a graph that includes your points from earlier and the values at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years. Can you explain why the equation doesn't make sense after around 3 years?

						The lake by Rodney's condo was stocked with bass (fish) 10 years ago. There were initially 400 bass introduced. The carrying capacity of the lake is estimated at 4,000 bass. Two potential models for the number of bass (<m>B</m>) over time, where <m>Y</m> measures the years from when the lake was stocked 10 years ago are
