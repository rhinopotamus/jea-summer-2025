	<exercise xml:id="heat-index-tables-graphs-ex">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The table shows the <q>heat index</q> as a function of humidity at an air temperature of 88<m>^\circ</m>F. With up to about 40% humidity, 88<m>^\circ</m>F feels like it's 88<m>^\circ</m>F. But if the humidity rises to 60%, then it feels like it is 95<m>^\circ</m>F; that is, the heat index is 95<m>^\circ</m>F.
