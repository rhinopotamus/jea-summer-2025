						The population of China in 2011 was approximately 1.343 billion and growing at around 0.48% per year. An equation estimating the population of China is <me>P = 1.343 \ast 1.0048^Y</me> where <m>P</m> is the population of China (measured in billions) and <m>Y</m> is the years since 2011.

						Suppose a special kind of window glass is 1 inch thick and lets through only 75% of the light. If two thicknesses of this glass are used, the product is 2 inches thick and lets in 56.25% since <me>75\% \text{ of } 75\% = (0.75)(0.75) = 0.5625 = 56.25\%</me> <em>Story also appears in 3.4 and 5.4 Exercises</em>

						Wind turbines are used to generate electricity. For a particular wind turbine, the equation <me>W = 2.4 S^3</me> can be used to calculate the amount of electricity generated (<m>W</m> watts) for a given wind speed (<m>S</m> mph), over a fixed period of time.

						After his first beer, Stephen's blood alcohol content (BAC) was already 0.04 and as he continued to drink, his BAC level rose 45% per hour. The equation is <me>S = 0.04 \ast 1.45^H</me> where <m>S</m> is Stephen's BAC and <m>H</m> is the time, measured in hours.

						Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10'<m>\times</m>25' vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around. The amount of gravel they need (<m>G</m> cubic feet) is given by the equation <me>G = W^2 + 17.5W</me> where <m>W</m> is the width of the path in feet.
