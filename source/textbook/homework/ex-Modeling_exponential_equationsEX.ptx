						Um Archivo data consultant group reported earnings of $42.7 billion in 2012. At that time executives projected 17% increase in earnings annually. Based on that information, we wrote the equation <me>U = 42.7 \ast 1.17^Y</me> where <m>U</m> is Um Archivo's reported earnings (in $billions) and <m>Y</m> is the years since 2012. <em>Story also appears in 2.2 Exercises</em>
					</p>
			
					<p><ol>
						<li>
								<p>
									According to your equation, in what year would Um Archivo's reported earnings pass $60 billion? Set up and solve an equation. Then check your answer.
								</p>
						</li>
			
						<li>
								<p>
									Repeat for $100 billion.

						In 1990 it was estimated that 2.5 million households watched reality television at least once a week. Executives predicted that number would increase by 7.2% each year. According to their estimates, how many millions of households watched reality television in 2000? In 2010? As part of your work, name the variables, find the annual growth factor, and write an exponential equation modeling reality television viewing.
