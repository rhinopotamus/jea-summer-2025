                What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph?

                How to calculate the intercept given the slope and an example (another point on the graph)?

            <p>
                Why an intercept might not make sense, for example if it's outside the domain of the function?

                When a linear function is a direct proportion?

        <li>
            <p>
                Why you cannot reason proportionally if the linear function is not a direct proportion?
