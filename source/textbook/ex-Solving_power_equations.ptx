	<exercise xml:id="bass-fishing-solving-power" component="html">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The lake by Rodney's condo was stocked with bass (fish) 10 years ago. There were initially 400 bass introduced. Rodney wonders what the annual percent increase of the bass has been and realizes he can calculate it from the number of fish now. He will use the equation <me>B=400 g^{10}</me> where <m>B</m> is the number of bass in the lake now and <m>g</m> is the annual growth factor. For each number of bass, first solve for <m>g</m> using the <xref ref="root-formula" text="title"/>, then calculate <m>r=g-1</m>. The percent increase is <m>r</m> written as a percent.
