				Mari volunteers answering calls for in the office of her local state government representative. The office has been receiving a lot of calls recently with about BPA, a chemical found in plastics. The callers want their representative to support a bill banning BPA. An equation that describes the number of total number of calls over time is the following: <me>C=\frac{837}{1+118\ast 0.8025^D}</me> where <m>D</m> is the time since January 1 (in days), and <m>C</m> is the total number of calls.

		<introduction>

				Even though all the callers support the bill, Mari isn't sure whether the calls represent the local constituents. Perhaps only supporters are calling her office, for example. So, she asks her pollster, Paul, to add this question to the list for his daily survey. Based on that survey, Paul estimates the percentage <m>P</m> of local constituents who support the bill on day <m>D</m> by the equation <me>P =100 - 87.3 \ast 0.992^D</me>
