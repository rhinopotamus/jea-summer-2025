		<exercise xml:id="comedy-anxiety-solving-linear" workspace="0.8in">
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Is laughter really the best medicine? A study examined the impact of comedy on anxiety levels. Subjects' anxiety levels were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 before and after the study. Levels averaged 4.3 before the study. There was no significant change in subjects in the control group. Subjects who watched the comedy videos showed a noticeable difference, and it depended on the hours of comedy watched. Anxiety levels fell an average of 0.098 (on the 1 to 5 scale) for each hour of comedy watched.

	<exercise xml:id="strawberries-solving-linear" component="web">

				The more expensive something is, the less likely we are to buy it. Well, if we have a choice. For example, when strawberries are in the peak of season, they cost about $2.50 per pint at my neighborhood farmer's market and demand is approximately 180 pints. (That means, people want to buy about 180 pints at that price.) We approximate that the demand, <m>D</m> pints, depends on the price, $<m>P</m>, as described by the equation <me>D = 305 - 50P</me>

				The stretch of interstate highway through downtown averages 1,450 cars per hour during the morning rush hour. The economy is improving (finally), but with that the county manager predicts traffic levels with increase around 130 cars per hour more each week for the next couple of years. Earlier we found the equation <me>C=1,450 + 130W</me> where <m>C</m> is the number of cars per hour during the morning rush <m>W</m> weeks since the country manage made her projection.
