                    The number of bacteria in a dish increases 10-fold each day. Note: 10-fold means <m>\times 10</m>. Suppose we had 1 microliter of bacteria at the start of the first day. That means after <m>T</m> days there will be <m>10^T</m> microliters of bacteria.

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    The equation <m>pH = -\log(H^+)</m> tells us the pH of a substance (on a scale from 0 to 14) based on its molar hydrogen ion concentration <m>H^+</m>. Don't let the notation here scare you: <m>pH</m> is a single quantity and <m>H^+</m> has nothing to do with exponents or adding.

                <p>
                    For example, lemon juice has <m>H^+= 0.0025</m> and so the pH of lemon juice is <me>-\log(0.0025) = \text{(-)} \log(0.0025) = 2.6020599913 \approx 2.6</me>

                        Lucky for Astra, their building is subject to rent stabilization laws and so their rent cannot increase by more than 3%. In how many years would their rent double under this cap? The answer is <m>\displaystyle \frac{\log(2)}{\log(1.03)}</m>.

                    Many young adults are at high risk of hearing loss because they crank the volume of music they're listening to, often to 2 trillion times the level humans can hear. Calculate that intensity in decimals using the formula <m>10\log(2 \ast10^{12})</m>. Prolonged sound above 70 decibels may damage your hearing and any loud noise above 120 decibels can cause immediate harm to hearing.
