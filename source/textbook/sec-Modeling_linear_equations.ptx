			A family with one full-time worker earning minimum wage cannot afford the local fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States. Even families earning above minimum can struggle to rent an apartment for less than 30% of their income. As a result, many people need affordable housing. There are various local, state, and federally funded programs as well as non-profit agencies working to increase availability.

			In our city there are about apartments considered affordable. So the city partnered with local developers to build more apartments each year. Our variables are
		</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
		<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
			<row left="minor" class="odd">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>A=</m> affordable housing (apartments) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
			</row>
			<row left="minor" class="even">
				<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>Y=</m> time (years from now) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

		<p>
			Assuming things proceed as planned, after 5 years there would be <me>\text{64,100 apts } + 5 \text{ years} \ast \frac{\text{7,800 apts}}{\text{year}}=\text{64,100}+\underline{5} \times \text{7,800} =  \text{103,100} \text{ apartments}</me> Generalizing, we get our equation <me>\text{64,100}+Y\ast \text{7,800} =  A</me> which can be rewritten as <me>A = \text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y</me> This equation fits our template for a linear equation <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } + \text{slope} \ast {\text{indep}}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Quick recap. A function is <term>linear</term> if its graph is a line, and <term>nonlinear</term> otherwise. The rate of change measures the steepness of the graph for any function, but a line is the same steepness everywhere, so the rate of change, or <term>slope</term> of a line is constant. Our example is linear because the slope of apartments per year is constant. Our starting or fixed amount is the <term>intercept</term>. In our example it’s apartments. The dependent variable and the intercept always have the same units – apartments in our example. But <me>\text{units for slope} =\frac{\text{units for dep}}{\text{units for indep}}</me> so, in our example slope is measured in apartments <em>per year</em>. These units can help you identify the slope and intercept in a story – so keep a look out.
		</p>

		<p>
			How many years will it take the city to reach apartments at this rate? After ten years, for example, there would still not be enough affordable apartments because <me>A = \text{64,100}+\text{7,800} \ast 10 = \text{64,100}+  \text{7,800}\times \underline{10}=  \text{142,100} \text{ apartments}</me> Continuing successive approximation we get

			This city will reach affordable apartments within 12 years.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, we could solve a linear equation instead. We want <m>A=\text{150,000}</m>. Using our equation <m>A=\text{64,100} + \text{7,800} Y</m> we get <me>\text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y = \text{150,000}</me> However, since we want <em>at least</em> affordable apartments, an inequality is even better. Let’s practice that. <me>\text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y \ge \text{150,000}</me> Subtract from each side to get <me>\begin{aligned}
\cancel{\text{64,100}} + \text{7,800}Y &amp; \ge &amp;\text{150,000}  \\
-\cancel{\text{64,100}} \hspace{.6 in} &amp; &amp; -\text{64,100}  \\ % SU awkward to use hspace!
\end{aligned}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			which simplifies to <me>\text{7,800}Y\ge \text{85,900}</me> Divide each side by to get <me>\frac{\cancel{\text{7,800}}~Y}{\cancel{\text{7,800}}} \ge \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}}</me> which simplifies to <me>Y \ge   \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}} = \text{85,900} \div \text{7,800} = 11.0128205...</me> To be sure <m>Y \ge 11.0128205...</m> we need to round up to get <me>Y \ge 12</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let’s confirm our findings on the graph.

		<p>
			As expected, the graph is a line. And we see that the city should reach its goal of affordable apartments in 12 years, or slightly before then.

								We looked at the city’s plan to increase the number of affordable apartments. From a current estimate of apartments classified as <q>affordable,</q> they hoped to build per year. At that rate, they can reach a total of apartments in 12 years.
							</p>
				
							<p><ol>
								<li>
											<p>
												Things change. Revised estimates call for only new apartments each year. At that rate, when will the city reach the apartments goal? Using the same variables as in this section, set up and solve an equation.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												More bad news. The definition of <q>affordable</q> has changed again, so the new count shows only apartments on the list. And still only new apartments each year. Now when will the city reach the apartments goal? Set up and solve an equation.
											</p>
								</li>
				
								<li>
											<p>
												In light of the new definition and, consequently, only apartments currently on the list, the city has received additional funding to up the number of apartments built each year. They would like to return to their goal of having affordable apartments in 12 years. How many apartments do they need to add each year to reach that goal? Figure out the answer however you like, but check that it works.

								At a local <term>state university</term>, the tuition each student pays is based on the number of credit hours that student takes plus fees. The university charges $870 per credit hour plus a $560 fee. The fee is paid once regardless of how many credits are taken.
							</p>
				
							<p><ol>
								<li>
											<p>
												Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
											</p>

								<li>
											<p>
												Find the slope and intercept and explain what each means in terms of the story.

												Make a table of values showing the tuition cost for 3 credits, 12 credits, or 16 credits.

							<p>
								At the local <term>community college</term>, the tuition each student pays is based only on the number of credits. The college charges $415 per credit.

							<p><ol>
								<li>
											<p>
												Using the same variables as before, write an equation relating them for the community college.

											<p>

											<p>
												What do you notice about the graph that confirms the community college is always cheaper?
											</p>
								</li>
				
							</ol></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
								Can you tell from the table which of these functions is linear? Use the rate of change to help you decide. Remember that numbers may have been rounded.
