		<title>Preface</title>

		<p>
			In 1994, my colleagues at Augsburg College (now Augsburg University) and I had a vision for a new course to replace our intermediate algebra course. We wanted a college level course that would serve primarily as preparation for quantitative courses across the curriculum. The framing question that led to our curricular adventure of the past nearly two decades was
		</p>

		<blockquote>
					<p>
			What algebra do college students need to know, and how can we make it relevant to their future studies, their lives as citizens, and their everyday life?
		</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			From these questions <em>Just enough algebra</em> was born.
		</p>

		<p>
			As you will see, everything we do is in some applied context. Our choice to focus primarily on linear and exponential models; to emphasize verbal, numerical, and graphical interpretation of functions; and to include only the most essential symbolic techniques align well with curricular guides from the MAA<fn>		<p>
			<em>Curricular Guide</em>, Committee on the Undergraduate Mathematics Program (CUPM) and <em>Curriculum Foundations Project: Voices of the Partner Disciplines</em>, Curriculum Renewal Across the First Two Years (CRAFTY), Mathematical Association of America (MAA), 2004 and CRAFTY’s <em>Recommendations for College Algebra</em>, 2007
		</p></fn> and AMATYC<fn>		<p>
			<em>Crossroads in Mathematics Standards for Introductory College Mathematics Before Calculus</em>, American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), 1995 and the follow up <q>Beyond Crossroads</q> report, AMATYC, 2006.
		</p></fn>. More importantly, it works. Student learn a lot in this course. They are ready for what comes next. And, they enjoy it.

			<title>To the student</title>

			<p>
				This textbook is written for you. Read the narrative examples, listen to examples in class, try the practice exercises (in the accompanying workbook), check with classmates or your instructor, then work the exercises in this textbook, then chat with classmates again, then do more problems, …. Well, you get the idea: the best way to learn mathematics is to do it yourself. I hope you enjoy the course. I know you will learn a lot of useful algebra. I believe it will change how you see mathematics.

				This textbook is written for students. That means you won’t find list of student learning objectives anywhere, although I’m sure you can infer them from the student-focused <q>Do you know …</q> questions in each section. While the narrative examples develop the main theme of each section, I’ve deliberately left some variations for the practice exercises. These practice exercises are designed to be started during class and are printed in a separate workbook for that purpose. Hand-written solutions to the practice exercises are available (in electronic format) for students to check their work, whether in class or at home.
			</p>

			<p>
				My greatest success in teaching this course has been to give students room to figure things out for themselves, so try to resist the temptation to show them one of everything. Listen to your students and help them understand the algebra in their own vocabulary. You will be impressed.

			<title>Acknowledgments</title>

			<p>
				Thanks, first, to the thousands of students who have taken this course. Their creative approaches to learning mathematics; their unedited criticism and challenge; their often surprising enthusiasm for the course; their patience tried by countless typos and outright mistakes; and their perpetually novel insights have humbled me and challenged everything I thought I knew about teaching and learning mathematics. They have inspired me time and time again. I am grateful that they have allowed me to make a difference in their lives.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanks, next, to my mathematics colleagues at Augsburg: Mathew Foss (now at North Hennepin Community College), who taught from the very first edition of the textbook back in 1997 and who collaborated in writing earlier versions; Matt Haines, Alyssa Hanson, Rich Flint, and the dozens of other professors who have taught the course over the years from various earlier editions of the textbook; John Zobitz and Jody Sorensen, who edited and created more exercises for this 2012 edition; and student helpers Ashley Gruhlke and Emma Winegar.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanks, also, to my colleagues across campus for allowing us to try something completely different and to my mathematics colleagues nationally for spurring me on. During the first few years I taught from <em>Using algebra</em> by Ethan Bolker. Much of my approach and probably more examples or exercises than I realize are derived from his vision and from the subsequent text by his colleagues Linda Kime and Judy Clark at University of Massachusetts, Boston.
			</p>

			<p>
				A special thanks to Dean Barbara Farley, Augsburg’s Center for Teaching and Learning, and Augsburg’s Undergraduate Research and Graduate Opportunity program for supporting my work through sabbaticals, travel grants, and summer research grants for both me and students.

		<title>Prelude</title>

		<p>
			You have been learning and using mathematics your entire life. And not just in school. At home, on the job, and as you go about your day. Perhaps you were pretty good at math in school, or perhaps it was a huge struggle for you, or something in between. You might be upset that you have to take another math class or you might be optimistic that this time around it’s gonna make sense – I’m hoping it will!
		</p>

		<p>
			While you have studied mathematics for many years in school, I suspect there’s a lot of mathematics you haven’t seen or used in awhile. That’s completely normal. The good news is you don’t need to know or remember <em>everything</em> you’ve ever seen in math classes to learn algebra. We will review what we need when we need it.
		</p>

		<p>
			These preludes present the key ideas about arithmetic operations (adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing) using a calculator and the order of operations (PEMDAS anyone?), decimal numbers, rounding, percentages, fractions, powers, and roots (like square roots). Think of the preludes as bumping into an old friend. You might share a few niceties, but you’ll need meet up for lunch another day to catch up more. So, while these preludes present the basics, we will revisit and use these topics throughout the course in more detail and you’ll have more chance to practice then.
		</p>

		<p>
			It’s important that you know that everyone can learn mathematics. Really, everyone. That means you. I hope this is a wonderful and successful experience for you and that by the end of this course you recognize your new and improved mathematical superpowers. I believe you can do it.
		</p>

			<title>Prelude: Approximation and Rounding</title>

			<p>
				How tall is that Maple tree? If you think about it, it is not obvious how to measure the height of a tree. We could measure to the highest leaf, but it seems odd to say that the tree is shorter if a leaf falls off. Or we could measure to the top of a branch, but it might bend lower in the wind. Or we could measure to the top of a thick enough branch, whatever that means. The point is that we don’t know how to measure the height of a tree that precisely. By the way, the word <term>precisely</term> refers to the number of decimal digits.
			</p>

			<p>
				Could the Maple tree be 93.2 feet tall? No way. That’s too precise. Is 93 feet tall correct? Maybe, but we could be off by a couple of feet depending on where we measure. Perhaps we can hedge slightly and call it 95 feet tall. Hopefully that’s reasonable. Or maybe we should play it really safe and say it is not quite 100 feet tall. The point is: there is no such thing as <q>the</q> right answer. When we ask a real world question, we want a real world answer. <em>The answer depends on the question.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				While it is good to keep as many digits as possible during calculations, at the end of a problem you should approximate the answer by <term>rounding</term> – finding the closest number of a given precision. The height of 93.2 feet was likely rounded to the nearest tenth (one decimal place). We rounded to the nearest whole number to get 93 feet. The point is that 93.2 is closer to 93.0 than it is to 94.0, so our answer is 93.0 or 93 feet.
			</p>

			<p>
				Perhaps this is a good place to mention the notation. We write <m>93.2 \approx 93</m> to indicate that we have rounded. The symbol <m>\approx</m> means <term>approximately equal to</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				How much to round off the answer depends on the question. To begin you should apply your common sense. Your answer should definitely sound natural, something you might actually say to a friend or your boss. But there’s also one more rule to know: <em>Your answer should not be more precise than the information in the problem.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, suppose we read that the comprehensive fee at a local university is around $ and projected to increase by 12% per year. We want to calculate the comprehensive fee in 4 years. As we’ll learn later in this course, the answer is <me>\text{36,190.945}\ldots</me> The dots indicate that we have not copied all the digits from the calculator. We could round to the nearest penny and say <q>around $.</q> Or, we could round to the nearest dollar and say <q>around $36,191.</q> The numbers we are given ($ and 12%) have only two digits that matter, however, so we should actually round off and say <q>just over $.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, when we refer to digits that matter, we are really referencing <term>significant digits</term>. That theory explains how combining numbers influences the number of digits in the answer that are accurate, which is why we wait until our final answer to round. In this text we do not follow those rules exactly, but you should be aware that some areas of study, such as Chemistry, do.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might be surprised to learn that approximate answers are not only good enough; they are often best. For one thing, in practice we want a round number so it is easy to understand and work with our answer. A rounded answer is just approximate. Also often the numbers we are given in a problem were rounded or approximated – for the record, that fee was really $, not $. When we start with approximate numbers, then no matter how precise the mathematics we use, we can only get approximate answers. Also, in much of this course the methods we will use to calculate answers are, themselves, approximate. We might <em>suppose</em> that tuition increases exactly 12% each year, when we know in reality that the percent will likely vary. That is an example of using an <term>approximate model</term>. Last, we might have an actual model but use some numerical or graphical technique for solving. That is an example of using an <term>approximation technique.</term> In either case, if the model or technique we use is approximate, then our answer can only be either. There is an old saying we try to live by in this course.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				I’d rather be approximately right than precisely wrong.
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				One more subtlety. We have been rounding to the nearest number of a given precision. That process is also known as <term>rounding off</term>. There are times when we will need to <term>round up</term> – to the next highest number of a given precision, or <term>round down</term> – to the next lowest number of a given precision.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, during Happy Hour at a local restaurant, buffalo wings sell for 60 per wing. Your buddy only has $7. After a quick calculation on his cell phone he decides to order a dozen wings. Your buddy probably calculated <me>7 \div .60 = 11.6666666\ldots \approx 12</me> Trouble is he cannot afford a dozen wings, because they would cost $7.20. (Check <m>12 \times .60 = \$7.20</m>.) Not to mention the tax, tip, and that beer he drank. Good thing you can point him to the bank machine so he can get cash and you won’t have to pay his tab (again). What’s the trouble here? Besides ignoring tax, tip, and that beer he rounded off when he should have rounded down <me>7 \div .60 = 11.6666666\ldots \approx 11</me> It should be clear form the story whether you will need to round off, round up, or round down. Again, our mantra is: the answer depends on the question.

			<title>Prelude: Arithmetic Operations</title>

			<p>
				Numbers, numbers everywhere – how do we put them together to get a final answer?
			</p>

			<p>
				As a first example, Zahra needs to complete 200 hours of classroom observation before she is eligible to student teach. She logged 45 hours last spring, another 42 hours this past fall, and is on pace to finish 51 hours this spring. How many more hours will she need next fall to finish here 200 hours?
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s begin by figuring out how many hours Zahra finished before this semester. She did 45 hours and then another 42 hours. We add to get the total number of hours. <me>45 + 42 = 87 \text{ hours}</me> If we add in the number of hours from this spring, her total will be <me>87 + 51 = 138 \text{ hours}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We assume you are using a calculator to add these numbers. It is a good habit to write down the keystrokes you do. Perhaps you did this sequence of keystrokes. <me>45 + 42 =</me> and then <me>87 + 51 =</me> That works, but it is not necessary to type the 87 in yourself. Instead try this sequence of keystrokes. <me>45 + 42 = + ~51 =</me> Did you get 138 again? When you typed that first equal sign the calculator should have displayed 87, and after the second equal sign, the final answer of 138. That works too, but the first equal sign is not needed. Try this shortest (best!) sequence of keystrokes. <me>45 + 42 + 51 =</me> Hopefully you got 138 again.
			</p>

			<p>
				How many more hours does Zahra need to reach the goal of 200 hours? We are looking for the number of hours where <me>138 + ~? = 200</me> We find the missing time by subtracting <me>200 - 138 = 62 \text{ hours}</me> You can check that <me>138 + 62 = 200</me> or, starting from the beginning <me>45 + 42 + 51+ 62 = 200</me> Any way you calculate it, Zahra is going to have a busy fall.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s another example. Cole was shocked by his credit card bill. It shows a previous balance of $529.16, credit for a payment of $200, finance charge of $42.78, a late fee of $30 (ouch!), a credit for $17.43 for a return he made, and $618.25 in new charges.
			</p>

			<p>
				Cole would like to practice his math and check the balance on his bill. One way to calculate his balance is to add the charges while subtracting the credits. Cole calculates <me>529.16 - 200 + 42.78 + 30 - 17.43 + 618.25 = \$1002.76</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes credits are represented by negative numbers. Another way Cole could calculate the answer is to add the mix of positive numbers (charges) and negative numbers (credits). <me>529.16 + \text{-}200 + 42.78 + 30 + \text{-}17.43 + 618.25 = \$1002.76</me> You may notice that the sign <m>-</m> subtraction and - used for negation look very similar. On the calculator these are two different keys. The subtraction key reads just <m>-</m>. The negation key often reads (-) and is done before the number. This does not mean you type in parentheses, just hit the key that is labeled (-) already. In this notation, we can write what Cole entered as <me>529.16 + \text{(-)}200 + 42.78 + 30 +  \text{(-)}17.43 + 618.25 =</me> Try it.
			</p>

			<p>
				(If your calculator does not have a key labeled (-), look for a key labeled <m>\text{+/-}</m> instead. That is not three keys, just one labeled <m>+/-</m> To emphasize that it is one key, we just write <m>\pm</m>. Often that key needs to follow the number, so enter the following keystrokes. <me>529.16 + 200 \pm + ~42.78 + 30 +  17.43 \pm + ~618.25 =</me> You should get $1002.76 again.)
			</p>

			<p>
				There are times when it is convenient to rewrite a sum in a different order. That can get tricky if there are both + and -. Rewriting each subtraction as addition of a negative keeps the minus signs where they belong. For example, Cole might have calculated <me>529.16 + 42.78 + 30 + 618.25 -200 - 17.43 =</me> Notice how the subtractions stay with the payment of $200 and credit of $17.43.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another example. There was a lot of snow this winter and the rainiest May anyone can remember. So now the river has been rising rapidly, 10 inches a day some say, for the past 3 weeks. How much has the river risen in total?
			</p>

			<p>
				We need to deal with some units here. How many days is 3 weeks? There are 7 days in a week so in three weeks there are <me>7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \text{ days}</me> Since multiplication is short for addition, we can calculate this number more quickly. <me>3 \times 7 = 21</me> (Most calculators have a <m>\times</m> key, but in some computer programs <m>\ast</m> is used instead.)
			</p>

			<p>
				At 10 inches per day, the river has risen <me>10 + 10 + 10 + \ldots + 10 \text{ inches \emph{(21 times)}}</me> which we calculate as <me>21 \times 10 = 210 \text{ inches}</me> The river has risen 210 inches.
			</p>

			<p>
				The river has risen 210 inches, you say? Hmm. How many feet is that? There are 12 inches in a foot so we want <me>12 \times ~? = 210</me> We find the missing rise by dividing <me>210 \div 12 = 17.5 \text{ feet}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				(Many calculators use a key labeled / instead of the more old fashioned <m>\div</m>. We use the notation <m>\div</m> since the slash has so many different meanings and is easily misread. Just remember to do / whenever you see <m>\div</m> in this book. Try <me>210 / 12 =</me> You should get 17.5 again.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Any way you calculate it, the river has risen 17.5 feet, or nearly 18 feet. Sadly it turns out that is 6 feet above flood stage for this stretch of river, so the flooding is causing a lot of damage.
			</p>

			<p>
				Two more examples. There are two other situations in which we divide. The first is fractions. If we are given a fraction, like <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of residents have Internet access, we might want to have a decimal approximation to do further calculations. We find it by dividing <me>\frac{2}{3} = 2 \div 3 = 0.666666666... \approx .67</me> The bar in between the 2 and 3 in the fraction stands for division. It might help to remember this connection visually. <me>\frac{~\bullet~}{\bullet}</me> So if there are 14,573 residents, and <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> have Internet access, then we can multiply to find the number of residents with Internet access. <me>14573 \times 0.7 = 9763.91\approx 9764</me> Since .67 only has two digits that matter (and we rounded up to get it), we would round our answer down to compensate and say there were around 9700.
			</p>

			<p>
				Can we say that there 9,764 residents with Internet access? If we had used .0.666666666 instead we would have calculated <me>14573 \times 0.666666666 = 9715.33332... \approx 9715</me> Sounds like we should play it safe and say over residents have internet access. The most accurate calculation would be to do the multiplication and division all at once. <me>14573 \times 2 \div 3 = 9715.33333... \approx 9715</me> It would be acceptable to estimate at 9,715 residents.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another cause for division is the word <q>per</q>. What is her pace, in minutes per mile if Karleen runs 6.3 miles in 50 minutes? <me>50 \div 6.3 =  7.936507937... \approx 7.9</me> With the units we would write <me>50 \text{ minutes} \div 6.3 \text{ miles }  \approx 7.9 \text{ minutes per mile}</me> Karleen runs just under 8 minutes per mile.

			<title>Prelude: Percentages</title>

			<p>
				In a recent basketball game against the Dallas Wings, Minnesota Lynx star Naphessa Collier took 16 free throws and made 11 of them. The fraction, or proportion, of free throws she made is <me>\frac{11}{16} = 11 \div 16 = 0.6875</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To calculate Collier’s free throw percentage, we need to remember how percents work. Luckily, the word <q>percent</q> is very descriptive. The <q>cent</q> part means <q>hundred,</q> like 100 cents in a dollar or 100 years in a century. And, as usual, <q>per</q> means <q>for each.</q> Together, <term>percent</term> means <q>per hundred.</q> For example, the number 20% means 20 for each hundred. Written as a fraction it is <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>. Divide to get the decimal <m>20 \div 100 = .20.</m> <me>\text{Think money:  }20\%\text{ is like }20\text{\textcent , and }.20\text{ is like }\$.20</me> Bottom line: 20%, <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>, and .20 mean exactly the same number. <me>20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 20 \div 100 = .20</me> Since we divided by 100 to go from percentage to decimal, we can reverse this process and go from decimal to percentage by multiplying by 100. Check it out: <me>.20 \times 100 = 20\%</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to Collier. She made 11 out of 16 free throws, which was <m>0.6875</m> of her free throws. Now we know <me>0.6875 \times 100 = 68.75 \approx 68.8\%</me> Her free throw percentage that game was 68.8%. Collier’s free throw percentage for the season is actually much lower, at 48.1%. How many free throws out of 16 would we have expected she would make? We need to figure out what 48.1% of 16 is. First, we convert 48.1 to decimal by dividing by 100: <me>48.1 \div 100 = .481</me> Next, we multiply that proportion by 16: <me>.481 \times 16 = 7.696</me> We can even do this calculation in just one step: <me>48.1 \div 100 \times 16 = 7.696</me> Either way, would have expected Collier to make 7 or 8 of her free throws. So, 11 was a really good night. Turns out she scored 29 points that game with 7 rebounds.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thang attended that Lynx-Wings game and ordered the hot chicken sandwich with pickles for $14.59. When she tapped her debit card to pay, the machine offered her three choices for tip: 10%, 15% or 20%. As you can check, the machine calculated that 10% tip would add $1.46, the 15% tip would add $2.19, and the 20% tip would add $2.92. Knowing that the concession staff that night was fundraising for a group she supports, Thang selected 20% and her total bill was <m>14.59 + 2.92 = \$17.51</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thang’s ticket was good for 10% off the purchase of Lynx merchandise from their website and there was free shipping, so she decided to buy a jersey normally priced at $99. Since 10% of $99 is <me>.10 \times 99 = 9.9</me> she knows that her discount will be $9.90. (I added the extra 0 at the end because $9.9 looked strange.) The net price for the jersey will be <me>\$99 - \$9.90 = 99 - 9.9 = 89.1 = \$89.10</me> With the discount, Thang can buy the jersey for $89.10.
			</p>

			<p>
				In general, we can find the result of a <term>percent increase</term>, like Thang’s sandwich plus tip, by calculating the percent and adding it to the original amount. And we can find the result of a <term>percent decrease</term>, like Thang’s on-sale jersey, by calculating the percent and subtracting it from the original amount.

				Remember Cole who was shocked by his credit card bill? His bill showed a previous balance of $529.16, credit for a payment of $200, finance charge of $42.78, a late fee of $30 (ouch!), a credit for $17.43 for a return he made, and $618.25 in new charges. How can we help Cole check his balance?
			</p>

			<p>
				The most direct way to calculate Cole’s balance would be step-by-step.

			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Cole found an even quicker way to check the balance. He did not hit <m>=</m> until the very end of the calculation. He just did the calculation all in one line. <me>529.16 - 200 + 42.78 + 30 - 17.43 + 618.25 = \$1002.76</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that there are both addition (<m>+</m>) and subtraction (<m>-</m>) operations in this one-line calculation. These two operations (<m>+</m> and <m>-</m>) are tied for priority in the order of operations, so the calculator works from left to right. This one line calculation is equivalent to doing the much slower step-by-step process!
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, the word <term>priority</term> means of higher importance and, therefore, coming before. For example, doing your math homework should be a higher priority than watching random videos online. But getting a good night’s sleep should be a higher priority than studying for a test. (You’ll have to trust me on that one.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Earlier we heard about the Nussbaums who planted a walnut tree. The tree was 5 feet tall when the planted it. It has grown around 2 feet a year. According to this information, the tree was <m>5+2=7</m> feet tall after one year, <m>7+2=9</m> feet tall after two years, <m>9+2=11</m> feet tall after three years, and so on. We wanted to know how tall the tree was after 18 years.
			</p>

			<p>
				One way to calculate the answer is to first figure out how much the tree grew in 18 years. That is <me>2+2+ \ldots + 2 \text{ \emph{(18 times)}}</me> which we calculate as <me>18 \times 2 = 36</me> Next, we add the original height plus how much the tree grew to get <me>36+5=41</me> The tree was 41 feet tall after 18 years.
			</p>

			<p>
				Inspired by Cole’s one-line calculation, let’s do this calculation all in one line. One option is <me>18 \times 2 + 5=</me> Notice we are only hitting the <m>=</m> key at the end. We get 41 feet, again.
			</p>

			<p>
				But wait! What if I wanted to enter the starting height first (5 feet) and then add on how much the tree grew (36 feet). I should be able to do that because <m>5 + 36 = 41</m> also. What happens when you enter <me>5+18 \times 2=?</me> You should get 41 again.
			</p>

			<p>
				Something strange is happening. Either the calculator is reading your mind (probably not possible yet, but Artificial Intelligence is making great progress), or the calculator has a secret order of operations. The calculator is not just working from left to right because that would be
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>5+18=\underline{23}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>\times 2=\underline{46}</m> Oops!</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				That is not what the calculator did. The calculator first did the multiplication (<m>18 \times 2 = 36</m>) and then did the addition (<m>5+36=41</m>). It turns out that multiplication (<m>\times</m>) is higher priority than addition (<m>+</m>) and subtraction (<m>-</m>) in the order of operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				You will need to know the full order of operations so that you know when the calculator is doing what you want. Here’s the full list of the <term>order of operations</term>, the priority ranking for arithmetic operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				We highlighted the letters PEMDAS which often helps people remember this order. (<q>Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally</q> is how I learned it.) Outside of the United States this rule has names such as BEDMAS, BIDMAS, BODMAS, PODMAS, PIDMAS, or even GEMDAS. Notice that multiplication (<m>\times</m>) and division (<m>\div</m>) are tied for priority just like addition (<m>+</m>) and subtraction (<m>-</m>) were.
			</p>

			<p>
				The good news is that your calculator does the operations in exactly this order. For example, remember Jarron who was calculating his BMI? He entered <me>91.625 \div 1.93 \land 2 = 24.7479... \approx 24.8</me> which is in the range considered healthy. Of course, there are many more factors to health besides height and weight. Like getting enough exercise is really important. But, back to the calculation, how did that work?
			</p>

			<p>
				According to the order of operations, the calculator did the exponent (<m>\land</m>) first and then the division (<m>\div</m>) second. Let’s check it out:

			<p>
				That’s correct because exponents (<m>\land</m>) are higher priority in the order of operations than the other arithmetic operations (<m>\times, \div, +, -</m>).
			</p>

			<p>
				Remember that <m>1.93 \land 2</m> is short for <m>1.93\times 1.93</m>. Don’t believe me? Try both on your calculator to see. Your calculator may have a key marked <m>\land</m> or it might be marked <m>y^x</m>. We will come back to exponents in more depth later.
			</p>

			<p>
				What can we do if we want the calculator to work in a different order? For example, suppose in the Asian student association that there are 3 students Chinese students, 15 Hmong students, 11 Vietnamese students, and 5 students who do not identify with any of these ethnicities. We’d like to report the percentage of students in the group who are Hmong.
			</p>

			<p>
				First we need to calculate the total number of students <me>3+15+11+5 = 34</me> There are 34 students and 15 identify as Hmong. That means the proportion of Hmong students is <me>15 \div 34 = 0.4411...</me> and so the percentage of students in the group who are Hmong is <me>0.4411 \times 100 = 44.11 \approx 44 \%</me> Notice we can do these last two calculations in one line as <me>15 \div 34 \times 100 = 0.4411...</me> because multiplication (<m>\times</m>) and division (<m>\div</m>) are tied for priority in the order of operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Can we do the entire calculation in one line? Sure, but it does not work to do <me>15 \div 3 + 15 + 11 + 5 \times 100=531 \text{ Oops!}</me> What did the calculator do? Since multiplication (<m>\times</m>) and division (<m>\div</m>) are higher priority than addition (<m>+</m>), the calculator first figured out that <m>15\div 3 = 5</m> and <m>5 \times 100 = 500</m> and then it calculated <m>5 + 15 + 11 + 500 = 531</m>. Argh
			</p>

			<p>
				We wanted the calculator to do the addition (<m>+</m>) first. That’s not the order of operations the calculator will use. What can we do to fix that? Parentheses to the rescue! Parentheses have the highest priority in the order of operations, meaning the calculator will evaluate inside the parentheses before doing any other operations. So we can do this calculation all in one line by using parentheses as <me>15 \div (3 + 15 + 11 + 5) \times 100= 44.11... \text{ Whew!}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				As you work through the exercises, challenge yourself to find one-line calculations to use. You are always welcome to do the slower step-by-step method to check.

			<title>Prelude: Fractions</title>

			<p>
				Piadina’s Restaurant specializes in flatbreads. My favorite is the grilled vegetable flatbread with smoked almond Muhammara (a sauce made from almonds, red bell peppers, red chili peppers, pomegranate molasses, cumin, lemon juice, and olive oil). Last night I ordered that flatbread and a salad for dinner. They serve each flatbread cut into 5 slices.
			</p>

			<p>
				<image source='Flatbread slices.png'/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out the salad was pretty big and so I only ate 3 slides of flatbread. One way to describe how much of the flatbread I ate is using the fraction <m>\frac{3}{5}</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				When I mentioned my dinner to my friend Hayfa she had a strange response: <q>Last time I ate a flatbread at Piadina’s I only ate <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of what you ate.</q> I quickly figured it out that since I ate 3 slices and she ate <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of that, she must have eaten 2 slices, which we can calculate as <me>\frac{2}{3} \times 3 = 2 \div 3 \times 3 = 2</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				I started to obsesses over these fractions. Remember that I ate <m>\frac{3}{5}</m> of the flatbread and Hayfa ate <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of what I ate. So she must have eaten <m>\frac{2}{3}</m> of <m>\frac{3}{5}</m>, right? That means <me>\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}</me> Ah yes! She ate 2 out of 5 slices, or <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> of the flatbread. That’s correct.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might remember that we multiply fractions by multiplying the numerator (top) and the denominator (bottom). Let’s do that <me>\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 5} = \frac{6}{15}</me> Uh oh. We got a different answer.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute. Check it out: <me>\frac{2}{5} = 2 \div 5 = .4 \text{ \quad and \quad}  \frac{6}{15} = 6 \div 15 = .4</me> Whew! The fractions <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and <m>\frac{6}{15}</m> are equal.
			</p>

			<p>
				To see why, consider what happens when I cut the flatbread the other direction twice. Now the entire flatbread has 15 squares. Hayfa ate 2 slices out of the original 5 slices total. Or, equivalently, she at 6 squares out of 15 original squares. You may have heard of reducing or cancelling fractions, which is a way to remember what’s happening here:
			</p>

			<p>
				<image source='Flatbread squares.png'/>
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\frac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 5} = \frac{2 \times \cancel{~3~}}{ \cancel{~3~} \times 5} = \frac{2}{5}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				In practice when we have to evaluate a product of fractions we can do it a couple of ways. One way is to deal with each fraction separately:
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = 2 \div 3 \times 3 \div 5 = .4</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Another way is to calculate the top and bottom of the fraction and divide. Notice how we need to use parentheses around the top and bottom of the fraction.
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2 \times 3}{3 \times 5} = (2 \times 3)\div (3 \times 5) = .4</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, flatbreads at Piadina’s are pricey: $17.49 each. At that rate, what does each slice cost? We can use a fraction <me>\frac{\$17.49}{5 \text{ slices}} = \$17.49 \div 5 = 3.498 \approx \$3.50 \text{ per slice}</me> Notice that the units on my answer are dollars per slice: the units of the numerator (top) per the units of the denominator (bottom). We sometimes even write the units themselves as a fraction: <m>\frac{\$}{\text{slice}}</m>
			</p>

			<p>
				There will be a few times during this course where you encounter fractions. Mostly we’ll switch to decimal approximations right away.

			<title>Prelude: Powers and Roots</title>

			<p>
				Noah is very proud of his sobriety. He credits some of his success to handicrafts, like beading. He finds the steady, repetitive work of stringing beads one by one (or, actually, Noah prefers two by two) to be a calming practice and he enjoys flexing his artistic creativity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Noah’s mom also enjoys handicrafts and would like to build a small glass box to hold some of Noah’s beads. To keep things simple she has decided that the box will be a cube, meaning it will have the same length, width, and height. Plus, the cube has long been the symbol of regeneration and stability but also of limitations and boundaries – a fitting recovery gift.
			</p>

			<p>
				She could make a small box that’s <m>2 \times 2 \times 2</m>. That’s pronounced <q>2 by 2 by 2</q> and means 2 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. Such a small box would hold <m>2 \times 2 \times 2 =  8</m> cubic inches of beads, which is around 2/3rd of a cup (not much).
			</p>

			<p>
				What if Noah’s mom made a box that was <m>5 \times 5 \times 5</m> instead? That box would hold <m>5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125</m> cubic inches of beads, which is just over 2 liters of beads. Similarly a <m>10 \times 10 \times 10</m> box would hold <m>10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000</m> cubic inches of beads, or about 4 gallons of beads. In case you’re curious about the units here, there’s about 14.4 cubic inches per cup, 61 cubic inches per liter, and 231 cubic inches per gallon.
			</p>

			<p>
				When we multiply a number by itself, like <me>\underbrace{2 \times 2 \times 2}_{3 \text{ times}}</me> we say that we are raising 2 <term>to the power of</term> 3. The number 3, which counts how many times we multiply 2 by itself, is called the <term>power</term> or <term>exponent</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				On a calculator we can use the <m>\land</m> key. Try for yourself: <me>2 \land 3 = \underbrace{2 \times 2 \times 2}_{3 \text{ times}} = 8</me> <me>5 \land 3 = \underbrace{5 \times 5 \times 5}_{3 \text{ times}} = 125</me> <me>10 \land 3 = \underbrace{10 \times 10 \times 10}_{3 \text{ times}} = 1000</me> No key marked <m>\land</m>? Look for a key marked <m>x^y</m> or <m>y^x</m> instead. Can’t find that either? Ask a classmate or your instructor for help.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can even do higher powers for practice:
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>3 \land 4 = \underbrace{3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3}_{4 \text{ times}} = 81</me> <me>2 \land 10 = \underbrace{2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2}_{10 \text{ times}}= 1024</me> Speaking of which, Noah thought it was fitting it is that his mom was using mathematical higher powers to build the glass box since learning to trust in a spiritual higher power was so important to his recovery.
			</p>

			<p>
				Noah would like the box to hold 1 gallon of beads which is about 231 cubic inches. What size cube box should his mom make? She wants a number, let’s call it <m>n</m>, so that an <m>n \times n \times n</m> box will hold 231 cubic inches. That means she needs <me>n \times n \times n = 231</me> or, equivalently, <me>n \land 3 = 231</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Noah’s mom can try to guess what number <m>n</m> should be. She wants a box that’s bigger than <m>5  \times 5 \times 5</m> but smaller than <m>10 \times 10 \times 10</m>. Her first guess is <m>n=7</m> inches, meaning the box will be <m>7 \times 7 \times 7</m>. That box would hold <me>7 \times 7 \times 7 = 7 \land 3 = 343 \text{ cubic inches}</me> which is too big. How about <m>n = 6.5</m> inches so the box would hold <me>6.5 \times 6.5 \times 6.5 = 6.5 \land 3  \approx 274 \text{ cubic inches}</me> which is still too big. After a few more guesses she tries <m>n = 6.2</m> so the box would hold <me>6.2 \times 6.2 \times 6.2 = 6.2 \land 3 \approx 238 \text{ cubic inches}</me> Aha! She will make a box that’s approximately <m>6.2 \times 6.2 \times 6.2</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				That was a lot of guessing. Turns out there’s a name for the answer. We write <me>n = \sqrt[3]231</me> and say that the dimension we are looking for is the 3rd <term>root</term> of 231.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can use our calculator to find roots. For example, if you have a key that says <m>\sqrt[x]{y}</m> then you can enter <me>3 \sqrt[x]{y} ~231 =  6.1357...</me> Different calculators label the roots key differently. For example, you may have to use one of the 2nd, Shift, or Inv key with the <m>\land</m>, <m>y^x</m>, or <m>x^y</m> key. On a graphing calculator, you may have to enter MATH mode.
			</p>

			<p>
				For practice, try evaluating the following roots on your calculator. Feel free to ask a classmate or your instructor for help if you can’t figure it out.
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\sqrt[3]{125} = 3 \sqrt[x]{y}~ 125= 5</me> <me>\sqrt[3]{1000} = 3 \sqrt[x]{y}~ 1000 = 10</me> <me>\sqrt[4]{81} = 4 \sqrt[x]{y}~ 81 = 3</me> <me>\sqrt[10]{1024} = 10 \sqrt[x]{y}~ {1024} = 2</me>

				By the way, <m>n \land 3</m> is sometimes called <m>n</m> <term>cubed</term> and <m>\sqrt[3]{~}</m> is referred to as the <term>cube root</term>. That terminology comes from the fact that the <m>n \times n \times n</m> cube has volume <m>n \times n \times n = n \land 3</m>, as in our example. Also note that the units on volume which are inches <m>\times</m> inches <m>\times</m> inches are called <term>cubic inches</term>.

				Similarly, <m>n \land 2</m> is called <m>n</m> <term>squared</term> and <m>\sqrt{~}</m> (which is shorthand for <m>\sqrt[2]{~}</m>) is referred to as the <term>square root</term>. Some calculators have a separate key for the square root. That terminology comes from the fact that an <m>n \times n</m> square has area <m>n \times n = n \land 2</m>. And a square that was <m>n \times n</m> in inches would have area measured in inches <m>\times</m> inches, which are called <term>square inches</term>.

				Minnesota had 35.5 inches of precipitation (rain and snow) in 2022, setting a new record. It is difficult to predict the weather.
			</p>

			<p>
				One report estimated that precipitation would increase an average of .2 inches per year. If that report is accurate then in 2032 (after 10 years) we would expect total precipitation to be around <me>35.5 + 10 \times .2 = 37.5 \text{ inches}</me> We can use the letter <m>Y</m> to represent the number of years in the future (since 2022).
			</p>

			<p>
				After <m>Y</m> years, we would expect total precipitation (in inches) to be around <me>35.5 + Y \times .2</me> This expression generalizes our earlier calculation, replacing the 10 years by the <m>Y</m> years. This expression is often written as <me>35.5 + .2Y</me> Notice that we are writing the number (.2) before the letter (<m>Y</m>). Also, we are not writing the multiplication symbol (<m>\times</m>) at all! It is something you just need to know: that <m>.2Y</m> really means <m>.2 \times Y</m>. That shorthand is an example of algebraic notation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another report estimated that precipitation would increase about 0.5% per year. Notice that percentage is less than 1%. It is much more complicated to figure out what to expect in 2032 (after 10 years), but following some examples we saw in the last section, it turns out that we can calculate the predicted precipitation to be <me>35.5 \times 1.005 \land 10 = 37.3154... \approx 37.3 \text{ inches}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				After <m>Y</m> years, we would expect total precipitation (in inches) to be around <me>35.5 \times 1.005 \land Y</me> This expression generalizes our earlier calculation, replacing the 10 years by the <m>Y</m> years. This expression is often written as <me>35.5*1.005^Y</me> Notice that we are writing the exponent as a superscript (meaning raised up and a little smaller). Also notice that we have replaced the usual multiplication symbol <m>\times</m> with an alternative symbol <m>*</m>. That’s because <m>\times</m> looks like the letter <m>X</m> which is sometimes used in algebra. This shorthand is another example of algebraic notation. The expression can also be written without the <m>*</m> symbol as <me>35.5(1.005^Y)</me> where now we need to know that the number before the parentheses is multiplied.
			</p>

			<p>
				For a little more practice with algebraic notation, recall that Piadina’s flatbread cost $17.49 and is usually cut into 5 slides. At that rate it cost <me>17.49 \div 5 = \$3.50</me> per slice. If there were <m>S</m> slices, then we can replace the 5 slices by <m>S</m> slices and calculate that the flatbread cost <me>17.49 \div S</me> in dollars per slice. In algebraic notation, we write the division as a fraction instead <me>\frac{17.49}{S}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				One more piece of terminology. When we have an expression, like <m>\frac{17.49}{S}</m> and we want to know the value when <m>S</m> is a particular value, we say that we are <term>evaluating</term> the expression. Suppose we want to know the price per slice if Piadina’s cut their flatbread into 4 slices instead. That means we want to evaluate the expression <m>\frac{17.49}{S}</m> when <m>S = 4</m> slices.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first step in the evaluation process is to replace the letter by its value and we write that value in parentheses. Thus we would have <me>\frac{17.49}{(4)}</me> The second step is to replace the algebraic notation with the arithmetic notation, which is usually what we enter into the calculator: <me>17.49 \div (4)</me> It turns out that we do not need the parentheses around the 4 so we can simply calculate <me>17.49 \div 4 = 4.3725 \approx \$4.37 \text{ per slice}</me>

				Tara is working on a big project at work. She wants to back up her files to her online drop box. The site says she has 72 GB of memory remaining. Tara has about 200 files at an average of 42.3 MB each that she would like to upload. Will she have room?
			</p>

			<p>
				To answer Tara’s question we need to know that GB is short for <q>gigabyte</q> and MB is short for <q>megabyte.</q> A <term>byte</term> is a very small unit of computer memory storage space just enough for about one letter. You may have heard the word <q>mega</q> used to mean <q>really big.</q> There’s a reason for that. <term>Mega</term> is short for 1 million. That’s pretty big. But <term>giga</term> stands for 1 billion, so that’s even bigger. So, really
			</p>

			<p>
				What all this means is Tara has <me>72\text{ GB} = 72 \text{ billion bytes} = \text{72,000,000,000 bytes}</me> of memory remaining. She would like to save 200 files at 42.3 MB each which comes to <me>200 \times 42.3 = \text{8,460 MB}</me> which is really <me>\text{8,460 MB} = \text{8,460 million bytes} = \text{8,460,000,000} \text{ bytes}</me> <me>= 8.46 \text{ billion bytes} = 8.46 \text{ GB }</me> So Tara wants to store less than 9 GB of information and she has 72 GB remaining. She has plenty of room. Save away!
			</p>

			<p>
				Really large numbers, like , are awkward to read and awkward to work with. Words like million and billion or metric prefixes (words like mega and giga) allow us to rewrite these large numbers in a way that’s much easier both to read and to work with. There’s another option that’s used often in the sciences (and by your calculator). To explain it we need to understand powers of 10.
			</p>

			<p>
				Perhaps you know what happens when we multiply a number by 10, like <m>5 \times 10 = 50</m> or, more appropriate to our example, <me>8.46 \times 10 = 84.6</me> The effect of multiplying by 10 is to move the decimal point one place to the right. When we multiply by we get <m>5 \times \text{1,000} = \text{5,000}</m> or, for our example, <me>8.46 \times \text{1,000} = \text{8,460}</me> The effect of multiplying by is to move the decimal point three places to the right. The connection is that <me>10^3=10 \times 10 \times 10  =\text{1,000}</me> Each <m>\times 10</m> has the effect of moving the decimal point one place to the right so <m>\times \text{1,000}</m> has the same effect as multiplying by 10 three times, so the decimal point moves three places to the right. That means <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{8,460,000,000} &amp; = &amp; 8.46 \underbrace{\hbox{$\times 10 \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10 $}}_{\hbox{\begin{tiny} 9 times \end{tiny}}}  \\  %HSPACE
&amp; = &amp; 8.46 \ast 10^ 9 \\  
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				This shorthand is called <term>scientific notation</term>. The base is always 10. The exponent is always a whole number. The number out front, like 8.46 in our example, is always between 1 and 10, which means there’s exactly one digit before the decimal point (and any others must come afterwards). It is customary to use <m>\times</m> instead of <m>\ast</m> in scientific notation, so we should write <me>8.46\times10^9</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				As another example, we saw earlier that <me>\text{5,000} = 5 \times \text{1,000} = 5 \times 10^3</me> You can check that <me>5 \times 10 \wedge 3 = 5000</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our large number. Enter <me>8.46 \times 10 \wedge 9=</me> What do you see? Some calculators correctly show <m>\text{8,460,000,000}</m> while other calculators report the number back in scientific notation, which is not particularly useful. (Sigh.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s try a number so big that (nearly) every calculator will switch to scientific notation. Enter <me>2.7\times 10 \wedge 30=</me> Look carefully at the screen. Your calculator might display something like <me>\boxed{~2.70000000 \quad \text{\begin{footnotesize}E \end{footnotesize}}~30~} \text{ \quad or \quad } \boxed{~2.70000000 \quad _{ \times \text{\begin{tiny}10 \end{tiny}}}~30~}</me> Whatever shorthand your calculator uses, you should write <me>2.7 \times 10^{30}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Interested in what that number is in our usual decimal notation? It’s <me>2, \underbrace{ \hbox{$\text{700,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000} $}}_{\hbox{\begin{tiny} decimal point moves 30 places \end{tiny}}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Enough of that. Poor Tara is pulling her hair out over this project. Well, not literally, but she is quite frustrated over how slowly the project is going. She wonders: how thick is a human hair?
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out that a typical human hair is about <m>.00012</m> meters across. Very small numbers are also awkward to read and awkward to work with. In this section, we write <m>.000~12</m> where the strange-looking space is to help you read the number.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can also describe really small numbers using scientific notation. Perhaps you know what happens when we divide a number by 10, like <m>50 \div 10 = 5</m> or, more appropriate to our example, <me>1.2 \div 10 = .12</me> The effect of dividing by 10 is to move the decimal point one place to the left. If we divide by instead, we get <me>1.2 \div \text{1,000,000} = .000~001~2</me> The connection is that <me>\text{1,000,000} = 10 \wedge 6</me> and so dividing by moves the decimal point six places to the left. Notice that we have to introduce zeros as placeholders.
			</p>

			<p>
				The width of a hair was .00012 meters. To get that number from 1.2, we need to move the decimal point 4 places to the left. <me>1.2 \div 10^4 = 1.2 \div \text{10,000} = .000~12</me> The shorthand for dividing by a power is to use negative exponents. For example <me>\div 10^4 = \times 10^{-4}</me> It has nothing to do with negative numbers. It’s just a shorthand. The point of this calculation was that <me>.00012= 1.2 \ast10^{-4}</me> Use your calculator to check!
			</p>

			<p>
				Once again we have scientific notation. The base is still 10. The exponent is still a whole number, although now it’s negative. The number out front, like 1.2 in our example, is still between 1 and 10, which means there’s exactly one digit before the decimal point (and any others must come afterwards). As before, we’ll write <m>\times</m> instead of <m>\ast</m> to get: <me>1.2 \times 10^{-4}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				When you see a number written in scientific notation, the power of 10 tells you a lot. For example, we saw that <m>8.46 \times 10^ 9 = \text{8,460,000,000}</m> and <m>1.2 \times10^{-4} = .000~12</m>. A positive power of 10 says you have a big number, and a negative power of 10 says you’re dealing with a very small number.

			<title>Prelude: Logarithms</title>

			<p>
				Nearlywed, hellscape, bodycon, and woke. Just a few new words added to dictionaries in 2023. People love to create new words and phrases. These new words spread through social media, music, and word of mouth.
			</p>

			<p>
				I created a new word <q>puzzlaxing</q> meaning relaxing by doing puzzles. In one week, maybe 10 people will have heard of it. After another week, perhaps 100 people. Then 1,000 the next week, and so on. How many weeks until 1 million people are have heard of my new word “puzzlaxing"?
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that in 1 week is <m>10 = 10^1</m> people, two weeks is <m>10^2 = 100</m> people, three weeks is <m>10^3=1000</m> people, and so on. We are looking for a number <m>W</m> where <m>10^W=\text{1,000,000}</m> people. Aha! <m>10^6=\text{1,000,000}</m> and so <m>W=6</m> weeks from now.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose we wanted to determine when 5,000 people had heard of <q>puzzlaxing</q>. That means we want a number <m>W</m> where <m>10^W = \text{5,000}</m>. Now what? The answer is somewhere between 3 and 4 weeks because <m>10^3=\text{1,000}</m> and <m>10^4=\text{10,000}</m>. That’s probably a good enough answer – between 3 and 4 weeks, but suppose we want the exact moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s try guessing. How about 3.5 weeks? <me>10^{3.5} =10 \wedge 3.5 = \text{3,162.27...}</me> which is much smaller than 5,000. How about 3.7 weeks? <me>10^{3.7} =10 \wedge 3.7 = \text{5,011.87..}</me> which is slightly bigger than 5,000. I want to find the answer here so let’s try <me>10^{3.69}=10 \wedge 3.69= \text{4,897.78...}</me> or finally <me>10^{3.699}=10 \wedge 3.699= \text{5,000.34...}</me> That’s as close as I’m gonna guess.
			</p>

			<p>
				Okay, I’m curious. Is there an exact power of 10 that gives 5,000? Your calculator should have a key that says <q>log</q> or maybe <q>LOG</q>. Try typing <me>\log(5000)=  3.6989700043...</me> A small note here about parentheses. Some calculators give the first parenthesis for free when you type log but you have to type the closing parenthesis in yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				Check it out, that’s the answer we were looking for <me>10^{3.6989700043} =10 \wedge 3.6989700043 = \text{4,999.999~999~5853...} \approx \text{5,000}</me> If we had kept more digits it would have been actually 5,000.
			</p>

			<p>
				What is this log key doing? First, log is short for logarithm base 10. There are other bases, but 10 is what we’ll focus on in this course. Try these calculations:
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\begin{aligned}
\log (10) &amp; = &amp; 1 \\
\log (100) &amp; = &amp; 2 \\
\log (\text{1,000}) &amp; = &amp; 3 \\
\log (\text{10,000}) &amp; = &amp; 4 \\
\log (\text{100,000}) &amp; = &amp; 5 \\
\log (\text{1,000,000}) &amp; = &amp; 6 \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What do you see? In each case the logarithm is the number of zeros or, equivalently, it’s the power of 10. For example, 10,000 has 4 zeros and <m>10^4= \text{10,000}</m> and <m>\log(\text{10,000}) = \log(10^4)=4</m>. In other words, a logarithm is just an exponent. And logarithms help us find the exponent. Makes sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				What logs of numbers that aren’t just powers of 10? Here are some examples. <me>\begin{aligned}
\log (25) &amp; = &amp; 1.3979\ldots \\
\log (250) &amp; = &amp; 2.3979\ldots \\
\log (\text{2,500}) &amp; = &amp; 3.3979\ldots \\
\log (\text{25,000}) &amp; = &amp; 4.3979\ldots \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To see what’s happening we want to involve powers of 10. Scientific notation will do that for us. Let’s write these numbers in scientific notation and see what we learn. For example <m>\text{25,000} = 2.5 \times 10^4</m> and <me>\log( \text{25,000})=\log(2.5 \times 10 ^4)=4.3979\ldots \approx 4</me> Before we write down a general rule, let’s check more numbers.
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\log(\text{7,420,000}) = \log(7.42 \times 10^6)=6.870403905\ldots \approx 6</me> <me>\log (\text{4})=\log(4 \times 10^0)=0.602059991\ldots \approx 0</me> <me>\log (\text{.00917})= \log(9.17 \times 10^{-3}) = -2.037630664\ldots \approx -3</me> In every case we are rounding down, but it’s always the same:

		<title>Variables</title>

		<p>
			Believe it or not, algebra is useful. Really useful. It’s useful in later courses you might take in mathematics, statistics, science, social science, or business. But it’s also useful in real life. A lot of what happens in the world around us is easier to understand using algebra. That’s what this course is all about: using algebra to answer questions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The philosophy of this course is captured in this quote by Ethan Bolker from his text <em>Using algebra</em>.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
					<p>
			With common sense and some algebra you can understand the world better than you can with common sense alone.
		</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			In this first chapter we introduce the key concepts of variable and function that help us translate between problems stated in words and the mathematics explaining a situation. We explain the important tools of units, tables, and graphs. We also describe how functions change using the fundamental concept of rate of change. Throughout this chapter we keep a careful eye on evaluating the reasonableness of answers by connecting what we learn from algebra with our own life experience. After all, an answer to a real problem should make sense, right?
		</p>

		<p>
			Some of our approach may feel strange to you. It is possibly very different from what you’ve seen in mathematics classes before. It might take you a little time to get used to, but it will be worth it.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>


		<subsection xml:id="variables-and-functions">
			<title>Variables and functions</title>

			<p>
				Things change, like the price of gasoline, and just about every day it seems. What does it mean when the price of a gallon of gas drops from $3.999/gal to $3.299/gal? The symbol / is short for <q>per</q> or <q>for each,</q> so that means each gallon costs <me>\$3.999-\$3.299=\$.70 = 70\text{\textcent}</me> less. Does this 70truly matter?
			</p>

			<p>
				Before we answer that question, are you wondering why there’s that extra 9 at the end of the price? We might think a gallon costs $3.99 but there’s really a small 9 following it. Sometimes that 9 is raised up slightly on the gas station sign. You have to read the fine print. What it means is an extra <m>\frac{9}{10}</m>for each gallon. So the true price of a gallon gas would be $3.999. Gas costs a tiny bit more than you thought. Good grief.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our question. Does 70truly matter to us? Probably not. Can’t even buy a bag of potato chips for 70. But, how often do you buy just one gallon of gas? Typically you might put five, or ten, or even twenty gallons of gas into the tank. We want to understand how the price of gasoline influences what it really costs us at the pump. To do that let’s compare our costs when we buy ten gallons of gas. There’s no good reason for picking ten; it’s just a nice number to work with.
			</p>

			<p>
				If gas costs $3.999/gal and we buy 10 gallons, it costs <me>10 \text{ gallons} \ast \frac{\$3.999}{\text{gallon}} = 10 \times 3.999  = \$39.99</me> See how we described the computation twice? First, with units, fractions, and <m>\ast</m> for multiplication in what’s sometimes called <q>algebraic notation.</q> Then, with just numbers and <m>\times</m> for multiplication – that’s what you can type into a calculator.
			</p>

			<p>
				If gas drops to $3.299/gal and we buy 10 gallons, it costs <me>10 \text{ gallons} \ast \frac{\$3.299}{\text{gallon}} = 10 \times 3.299  = \$32.99</me> That’s $7 less. For $7 savings on gas you could buy that bag of potato chips, and an iced tea to go with it, and still have change. That amount matters. I mean, especially since it’s $7 savings every time you put 10 gallons in the tank.
			</p>

			<p>
				Gas prices have been changing wildly, and along with them, the price of 10 gallons of gas. In mathematics, things that change are called <term>variables</term>. The two variables we’re focusing on in this story are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>P=</m> price of gasoline ($/gal)</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>C=</m> total cost ($)</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Notice that we gave each variable a letter name. It is helpful to just use a single letter chosen from the word it stands for. In our example, <m>P</m> stands for <q>price</q> and <m>C</m> stands for <q>cost</q>. In this course we rarely use the letter <m>X</m> simply because so few words begin with <m>X</m>. Whenever we name a variable (<m>P</m>) we also describe in words what it represents (the price of gasoline), and we state what units it’s measured in ($/gal).
			</p>

			<p>
				In talking about the relationship between these variables we might say <q>the cost depends on the price of gas,</q> so <m>C</m> depends on <m>P</m>. That tells us that <m>C</m> is the <term>dependent variable</term> and <m>P</m> is the <term>independent variable</term>. In general, the variable we really care about is the dependent variable, in this case <m>C</m> the total amount of money it costs us. The concept of dependence is so important that there’s yet another word for it. We say that <m>C</m> is a <term>function</term> of <m>P</m>, as in <q>cost is a function of price.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				Knowing which variable is independent or dependent is helpful to us. To emphasize the dependence, we often make a notation next to the variable name.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->

			<p>
				This labeling is rarely used outside this textbook, so add it in for yourself if you need it. In some situations dependency can be viewed either way; there might not be one correct way to do it. Labeling the dependence is extra important then, so anyone reading your work knows which way you are thinking of it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given a choice, we usually assign dependence such that given a value of the independent variable, it is easy to calculate the corresponding value for the dependent variable. In our example it’s easy to use the price per gallon, <m>P</m>, to figure out the total cost, <m>C</m>. We can work backwards – from <m>C</m> to <m>P</m> – but it’s not as easy.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, suppose we buy 10 gallons of gas and it costs $28.99. We can figure out that the price per gallon must be <me>P=\frac{\$28.99}{10 \text{ gallons}}= 28.99 \div 10 = \$2.899 \text{/gal}</me> Notice that we use the fraction as part of the algebraic notation, but we use <m>\div</m> to indicate division on the calculator. Your calculator key for division may be <m>/</m> instead, which we reserve as a shorthand for <q>per.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				From our experience we have a sense of what gas might cost. In my lifetime, I’ve seen gas prices as low as 35.9/gallon in the 1960s to a high of $4.099/gallon recently. This range of values sounds too specific, so it would sound better to say something general like
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<q>Gas prices are (definitely) between $0/gal and $5/gal.</q>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				The mathematical shorthand for this sentence is <me>0 \le P \le 5</me> The inequality symbol <m>\le</m> is pronounced <q>less than or equal to</q>. Formally, the range of realistic values of the independent variable is called the <term>domain</term> of the function <m>C</m>. In this text, we rarely write the domain because it’s usually clear from the story what realistic values would be. The exercises in this section ask you to do so for practice.
			</p>

			<p>
				Be aware that there are often many different numbers in a story. Some numbers are examples of values the variables take on, such as $3.999/gal or $39.99 in our example. Other numbers are <term>constants</term>; they do not change (at least not during the story). The one constant in our story is that we are always buying 10 gallons of gas. Occasionally there are other numbers in a story that turn out not to be relevant at all, so be on the lookout.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our story. A report says that the average price of gasoline in Minnesota was $2.900/gal in 2010 and increased approximately 20% per year for the next several years. We would like to check what that says about the average price of gasoline in 2011 and 2012, say. (It is unlikely that the price increase continued much longer at that rate.)
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand what that report is saying, we need to remember how percents work. Luckily, the word <q>percent</q> is very descriptive. The <q>cent</q> part means <q>hundred,</q> like 100 cents in a dollar or 100 years in a century. And, as usual, <q>per</q> means <q>for each.</q> Together, <term>percent</term> means <q>per hundred.</q> The number 20% means 20 for each hundred. Written as a fraction it is <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>. Divide to get the decimal <m>20 \div 100 = .20.</m> <me>\text{Think money:  }20\%\text{ is like }20\text{\textcent , and }.20\text{ is like }\$.20</me> Bottom line: 20%, <m>\frac{20}{100}</m>, and .20 mean exactly the same number. <me>20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 20 \div 100 = .20</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To calculate the percent of a number we multiply by the decimal version. For example, <me>20\% \text{ of } \$2.900 = .20 \times 2.900 = \$.58</me> The report says the price increased by 20% each year, so by 2011 the price had increased an average of $.58. That 58 cents is not what gas cost in 2011. It’s how much <em>more</em> gas cost in 2011 compared to 2010. To see what the report projected for the 2011 cost we need to add that increase on to the original 2010 price. <me>\$2.099 + \$.58= \$3.48\text{ per gallon}</me> Sounds about right. Expensive, to be sure, but fairly accurate.
			</p>

			<p>
				For 2012, the price increased by 20% again. That means 20% of what it was in 2011. We can’t just add $.58 again. That was 20% of the 2010 value, and we want 20% <em>of the 2011 value</em>. Going to have to calculate that. <me>20\% \text{ of } \$3.48 = .20 \times 3.48 = \$.696</me> so the projected 2012 value was <me>\$3.48 + \$.696= \$4.176\text{ per gallon}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				One last note. The number 20% in the report sounds like a rough approximation. The report probably means the increase was around 20%, maybe a little less, maybe a little more. So our answers of $3.48/gal and $4.176/gal could be a little less or a little more too. But they sound so perfectly correct. To be safe, we really ought to round off these answers, to something more general like around $3.50/gal in 2011 or approximately $4.20/gal in 2012. Using our <q> approximately equal to</q> symbol we write <m>P \approx \$3.50</m>/gal in 2011 and <m>P \approx \$4.20</m>/gal in 2012.

				Lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, bad breath, stains on your clothes, and the expense. These are just a few of the consequences of smoking cigarettes. With what we know now about the dangers of smoking, are people smoking more or less than they were ten years ago, fifty years ago, or even one hundred years ago?
			</p>

			<p>
				Reality is, we don’t have information on each individual person’s smoking rate, so we can’t answer this question exactly. We do have information on the total number of cigarettes sold each year. So maybe we should look at that total. Uh oh, that isn’t going to work. There are way more people now than there were fifty or a hundred years ago. So, even if the same percentage of people smoke, and even if they each smoke the same amount as their predecessors did, we would have a much bigger number of cigarettes smoked now just because there are more people now.
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out a reasonable measure is to compare the number of cigarettes smoked per year <em>per person</em>. By taking into account the number of people we will be able to see whether people are smoking more or less, on average. That’s what we want.
			</p>

			<p>
				The table showing the smoking rate for select years. The smoking rate is the average cigarettes per year per person (adults).

				To make sense of these numbers, suppose there are five friends. Three don’t smoke at all, so that is 0 cigarettes in a year. Another smokes only occasionally, maybe 100 cigarettes a year. The fifth smokes <q>a pack a day,</q> which adds up to cigarettes in a year because <me>\frac{1\text{ pack}}{\text{day}} \ast \frac{20\text{ cigarettes}}{\text{pack}} 
\ast \frac{365 \text{ days}}{\text{year}} 
=20 \times 365
= \frac{\text{7,300 cigarettes}}{\text{year}}</me> (Not sure about this calculation? Not to worry. More about unit conversions in §1.4.) These five people smoke a total of <me>0+0+0+100+\text{7,300}=\text{7,400 cigarettes per year}</me> so when we divide by the number of people we get <me>\frac{\text{7,400 cigarettes per year}}{5 \text{ people}} = \text{7,400} \div 5 = \text{1,480 cigarettes per year per person}</me> which is less than the average of cigarettes per year per person for 2006 (the last year the CDC published the data), which is the way things seem to be heading.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can tell a lot of information from this table. For example, what was the smoking rate in 1965, and how does that compare to 2006? The answers appears in the table, a whopping cigarettes per person in 1965 and cigarettes per person in 2006.
			</p>

			<p>
				When did the consumption first pass ? That answer does not appear in the table, but we can use the information in the table to make a good guess. In 1940, there were an average of cigarettes per person per year and by 1950, there were . Somewhere between 1940 and 1950 the number first climbed above . More specifically, the number we’re looking for () is a lot closer to the 1950 figure () than to the 1940 figure (). So, it would be reasonable to guess close to 1950. I’d say 1947. Of course, you might guess 1946 or 1948, or even 1949 and those would be good guesses too.
			</p>

			<p>
				When did the consumption drop below again? This answer also does not appear in the table, but falls somewhere between 1975 when consumption was and 1990 when consumption was . Here I’d guess just before 1990, say in 1989.
			</p>

			<p>
				What’s changing are the number of cigarettes smoked per person per year and the year. Those are our variables. The smoking rate is a function of year, and it’s what we care about, so it’s the dependent variable. Time, as measured in years, is the independent variable.

			<p>
				Quick note on how we deal with actual years. Since the year 0 doesn’t make sense in this problem, it is convenient to measure time in years since 1900, since that’s the earliest year mentioned. Officially we should rewrite our table as:

				Notice where the variable names are listed in the table. In a horizontal format like this table, the independent variable (<m>Y</m>) is in the top row, with the dependent variable (<m>S</m>) is in the bottom row. If you want to write your table in a vertical format, that’s okay too. Just put the independent variable in the left column, with the dependent variable in the right column. It might help to remember that the independent variable goes first (either top or left) and the dependent variable follows (either bottom or right).
			</p>

			<p>
				Where the variables go in a table is not something you can figure out. It’s a <term>convention</term> – a custom, practice, or standard used within the mathematical community. Though based on reason, it often involves some arbitrary choice, which is why we can’t figure it out. So, whenever some practice is introduced to you as a <q>convention,</q> you need to memorize it.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
<!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Tables are useful because they contain specific numbers, but it can be difficult to guess or see general trends. For that, a picture is worth a thousand words – or numbers, in this case. By <q>picture</q> we mean a graph of the function.
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout this text, we draw graphs by hand. On graph paper. Seriously. You might wonder why we do that when graphing calculators, spreadsheet programs, graphing <q>apps,</q> or computer algebra systems all can draw graphs for us. The answer is we want to understand graphs better, and I promise that drawing them by hand will help you do that. (Different instructors have different opinions on the importance of graphing by hand, so be sure to ask your instructor what you are expected to do. Even if you’re allowed to use some type of graphing technology, I strongly encourage you to practice drawing graphs by hand as well.)
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a standard set-up for a graph.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='GraphLabelAxes.pdf'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				The graph is based on a horizontal line and vertical line, called the <term>axes</term>. Where they cross is a point called the <term>origin</term>. It represents where each variable is 0. By convention, the independent variable is measured along the horizontal axis, with larger values progressing to the right of the origin, and negatives to the left. Similarly, the dependent variable is measured along the vertical axis, with larger values progressing up from the origin, and negatives down. Each gridline counts the same number, called the <term>scale</term>, but the scale for the vertical may be different from the scale for the horizontal. Each pair of values of the independent and dependent variable from our table correspond to a point on our graph.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the graph of smoking rates, the independent variable is <m>Y</m>, the year, so that goes on the horizontal axis for our graph. Our dependent variable is <m>S</m>, the smoking rate, so that goes on the vertical axis. For the scale, it works nicely to count by 10s for years and count by 500s for the smoking rate.
			</p>

			<p>
				There’s a certain amount of guess and check involved in figuring out a good scale for each axis. As a general rule of thumb we would like the graph to be as large as possible so we can see all of its features clearly. But, not so big that it runs off the graph paper. What matters is that the gridlines are evenly scaled and that they can handle large enough numbers. Speaking of which, it’s a good idea to leave a little room to extend the graph a little further than the information we have in the table, in case we get curious about values beyond what we have already.

				With realistic numbers it’s normal to have numbers in the table that are not exactly where the gridlines are. It is very helpful to count by round numbers (2s, 5s, 10s, etc.) because it makes guessing in between easier. Easier for you drawing the graph. Easier for someone reading your graph.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->

			<p>
				To plot each point, we start at the origin and move right to that <m>Y</m>-value, and then up to that <m>S</m>-value. When a value doesn’t land exactly on a grid mark, we have to guess in between. For example, in 1900, when <m>Y=0</m> so we don’t move right at all, just up to <m>S=54</m>. The first labeled gridline on our graph is 500. Where’s 54? It’s between 0 and 500, very close to 0. Our point is just a tiny bit above the origin. In 1915 we have <m>Y=15</m>. Our labeled gridlines are for 10 and 20, so 15 must land halfway in between. The smoking rate to 285, which is around halfway between 0 and 500. Etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				What we have so far is a <term>scatter plot</term> of points. Can you see why it’s called that? Anyway, our whole goal here was to be able to understand smoking rates better by having a graph. You may already begin to see a curve suggested by the points. Time to draw it in. I don’t mean drawing a line between each pair of points, like you do in the children’s game <q>connect the dots.</q> That isn’t quite right. It was probably more of a continuous trend and so the graph should be smoother.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='CigCurve.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				When we draw in this smooth curve for the graph, what we are really doing is making a whole lot of guesses all at once. For example, from the table we guessed that the smoking rate passed in around 1947, and dropped back to that level in around 1989. What does the graph show? If we look where the horizontal gridline for crosses our graph, it crosses in two places. First, between the vertical gridlines for 40 and 50, and perhaps slightly closer to 50. I’d say <m>Y \approx 47</m>, in the year 1947. Sure. The second time is between the gridlines for 80 and 90, much closer to 90. Looks like <m>Y \approx 88</m>, in the year 1988. We guessed 1989. Close enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				Don’t forget that when we drew in that curve it was really just a guess. We’re sure about the points we plotted, but we’re only guessing about where to draw the curve in. That means we’re not sure about the other points. If we knew a lot more points we could have a more accurate graph.
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out more data is available from the CDC. The full table of data from the CDC shows that consumption first topped as early as 1944. Here’s an example where the history tells you more than the mathematics as cigarette consumption rose sharply during World War II. Our guess about 1988 or 1989 was spot on. Look at how the graph from the full data (the dotted line) compares to our guess.

				In case you’re wondering, 3 meters is nearly 10 feet up and the highest height listed, 4.48 meters, is close to 15 feet above the water. More on how we figured those numbers out in the next section, but thought you might like to know.
			</p>

			<p>
				How fast is she moving? The diver starts at 3 meters, which is the height of the springboard, and .2 seconds later she’s up to 3.88 meters. That means during the first .2 seconds, the diver went up <me>3.88-3 = .88 \text{ meters}</me> Her speed is <me>\frac{.88 \text{ meters}}{.2 \text{ seconds}} = 0.88 \div .2 = 4.4 \text{ meters/sec}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What about during the next .2 seconds? Does she move faster, slower, or the same? During this time, her height changed from 3.88 meters to 4.38 meters. In these .2 seconds she rose <me>4.38-3.88 = .50 \text{ meters}</me> That’s less than before (since <m>.50 &lt; .88</m>), which means so she is going slower. Let’s double check by calculating her speed. <me>\frac{.50 \text{ meters}}{.2 \text{ seconds}} = .50 \div .2 = 2.5 \text{ meters/sec}</me> Yup, slower.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s take a look at this calculation again. Here’s what we did. <me>\text{speed} =  \frac{4.38-3.88 \text{ meters}}{.4-.2 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{.50 \text{ meters}}{.2 \text{ seconds}} = .50 \div .2 = 2.5 \text{ meters/sec}</me> There is a way to do the entire calculation at once on your calculator. <me>(4.38-3.88) \div (.4-.2)=2.5 \text{ meters/sec}</me> See how we put parentheses around both the top and bottom of the fraction? We needed them to force the calculator to do the subtractions first and division second. The usual order of operations would do it the other way around: multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. (If you need a reminder, the full list of the order of operations appears later, in Section 1.5.) Because the top and bottom of the fraction each have meaning in the story, we continue to calculate them separately, but feel free to do the whole calculation at once if you prefer.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that we are subtracting <term>like terms</term>: meters from meters and then seconds from seconds. It would not make sense to mix. Think: <me>\text{children} -  \text{cookies} = \text{crying}</me> so we don’t want to mix units because that would be like taking cookies away from children.
			</p>

			<p>
				In our story, we calculated the speed of the diver. In general, that number is the <term>rate of change</term> of the function over that interval of values.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice how the change in dependent variable (height, in meters) is on top of the fraction and the change in independent variable (time, in seconds) is on the bottom. That makes sense in our example because speed is measured in meters/second. The units can help you keep that straight. <me>\text{units for rate of change} = \frac{\text{units for dep}}{\text{units for indep}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our diver. During the next time interval she’s moving even slower. <me>\text{speed} = \frac{4.48-4.38 \text{ meters}}{.6-.4 \text{ seconds}}= \frac{.1 \text{ meters}}{.2 \text{ seconds}} = .1 \div .2 = .5 \text{ meters/sec.}</me> And look what happens when we calculate her speed during the next time interval. <me>\text{speed} = \frac{4.20-4.48 \text{ meters}}{.8-.6 \text{ seconds}} =  \frac{-.28 \text{ meters}}{.2 \text{ seconds}} = \text{(-)}.28 \div .2 = -1.4 \text{ meters/sec}</me> What does a negative speed mean? During this time interval her height drops. She’s headed down towards the water. Her speed is 1.4 meters/sec downward. The negative tells us her height is falling. What goes up, must come down. Sure enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may notice that the signs for subtraction and negation each look like <m>-</m>. On the calculator these are two different keys. The subtraction key reads just <m>-</m>. The negation key often reads and is done before the number. This does not mean you type in parentheses, just hit the one key that is labeled already. (If your calculator does not have a key labeled (-), look for a key labeled <m>\text{+/-}</m> instead. That is not three keys, just one labeled <m>\text{+/-}</m> Often that key needs to follow the number, so enter <me>.28\text{ +/- } \div .2 =</me> You should get -1.4 meters/sec again.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are the speeds included in our table.

				Let’s graph our function. Notice that time is on the horizontal axis because it’s the independent variable and height is on the vertical axis because it’s our dependent variable: height depends on time.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='springboard_diver.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				As usual we drew in a smooth curve connecting the points, which illustrates our best guesses for the points we don’t know and we continued the graph until the height was zero (when the diver hits the water). The values from our table are indicated with big points to help explain what’s going on.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a way to see the rate of change from the graph. In the case of our diver, the graph looks like a hill. The curve goes uphill at first. Between the first two points it is rather steep and the rate of change is 4.4 meters/sec there. The next segment is less steep and that’s where the rate of change is less, down to 2.5 meters/sec. The third line segment is almost flat and that’s where the rate of change is only 0.5 meters/sec. Aha. The rate of change corresponds to how steep the curve is.
			</p>

			<p>
				We notice the same connection between the rate of change and steepness of the curve for the downhill portion, only this time all the rates of change are negative. The first downhill segment is not very steep and the rate of change is -1.4 meters/sec there. The next downhill segment has rate of change -3.4 meters/sec and the graph is steeper. The next two downhill segments are steeper and steeper yet and this time with rates of change -5.35 and -7.25 meters/sec.
			</p>

			<p>
				A little more vocabulary here. For the uphill portion of the graph, from 0 to just before .6 seconds, the rate of change is positive. The function is <term>increasing</term> there: as the independent variable gets larger, so does the dependent variable. After about .6 seconds, the graph is downhill and the rate of change is negative. The function is <term>decreasing</term> there: as the independent variable gets larger, the dependent variable gets smaller.
			</p>

			<p>
				When does the diver’s height stop increasing and start decreasing? When she’s at the highest height, some time just before .6 seconds into her dive. Before then her rate of change is positive. After that time her rate of change is negative. So, at the highest height her rate of change is probably equal to zero. Does that make sense? Think about watching a diver on film in very slow motion. Up, up she goes, then almost a pause at the top, and then down, down, into the water. At the top of her dive it’s as if she stands still for an instant. That would correspond to zero speed.

			<title>Units</title>

			<p>
				We know 5 city blocks and 5 miles are very different lengths to walk; $5 and 5 are very different values of money; 5 minutes and 5 years are very different amounts of time to wait – even though all of these quantities are represented by the number 5. Every variable is measured in terms of some unit. Since there are often several different units available to use it is important when naming a variable to state which units we are choosing to measure it in.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the last section we examined the height of a springboard diver and her speed in the air. But, how high is 3 meters? How fast is 4.4 meters per second?
			</p>

			<p>
				The metric unit of length called a meter is just over 3 feet (a yard). Let’s use <me>1 \text{ meter} \approx 3.281 \text{ feet}</me> We can use this conversion to change 3 meters to feet. <me>3 \text{ meters} \ast  \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ meter}} = 3 \times 3.281 = 9.843 \text{ feet} \approx 9.8 \text{ feet}</me> Since our conversion is just approximate, we rounded off our answer too.
			</p>

			<p>
				See that fraction? The 3.281 feet on the top and the 1 meter on the bottom are just two different ways of saying approximately the same distance. In other words, <me>\frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ meter}} \approx 1</me> A fraction where the top and bottom are equal quantities expressed in different units is sometimes called a <term>unit conversion fraction</term>. Because it’s equal to 1 (or at least very close to 1), multiplying by the unit conversion fraction doesn’t change the value, just the units.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might wonder how we knew to put the feet on the top and the meters on the bottom. One reminder for how this works is to think fractions. It’s like the meters on the top and bottom cancel, leaving the units as feet. <me>\frac{3 \text{ \cancel{meters}}}{1} \ast  \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}} = 3 \times 3.281 \approx 9.8 \text{ feet}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				One more idea to keep in mind when converting units: a few large things equals a lot of small things. Instead of buying a lot of small bags of ice to fill your cooler, you can buy a few larger bags of ice instead. In our example, a meter is much bigger than a foot. So it makes sense that a small number of meters (3 meters) equalled a larger number of feet (9.8 feet). That might seem backwards, but that’s how it works.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, 9.8 feet might sound like a funny answer. We’re much more used to a whole number of feet and then the fraction in inches. It’s 9 feet and some number of inches. To figure out the inches we look at the decimal part <m>9.8-9=.8</m>. That’s the part we need to convert to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we use the (exact) conversion <me>1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}</me> to get <me>.8 \text{ \cancel{feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ \cancel{foot}}} = .8 \times 12 = 9.6 \text{ inches} \approx 10 \text{ inches}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick caution here. We rounded off 9.843 to get 9.8 and then just used the .8 to find the extra inches. Maybe we should have used the .843 instead. Here’s what happens. <me>.843 \text{ \cancel{feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ \cancel{foot}}} = .843 \times 12 = 10.116 \text{ inches} \approx 10 \text{ inches}</me> Phew! Either way, the board is about 9 feet and 10 inches high. The common shorthand for this answer is 9’10". (That’s pronounced <em>9 foot 10</em>, as in our team’s new center is <em>6 foot 7</em>.) The ’ symbol indicates feet and " indicates inches.
			</p>

			<p>
				The highest height we had recorded for the diver was 4.48 meters. Now we know that’s <me>4.48 \text{ \cancel{meters}}  \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}} 
=4.48 \times 3.281= 14.69888\ldots \text{ feet} \approx 14.7 \text{ feet}</me> In feet and inches, that’s about 14 feet, 8 inches because <me>.69888 \text{ \cancel{feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \text{ \cancel{foot}}} = .69888 \times 12 = 8.38656 \text{ inches} \approx 8 \text{ inches}</me> The diver’s highest height was around 14’8".
			</p>

			<p>
				You might have guessed that 14.7 feet would be 14’7". I mean, that sort of looks obvious. The reason it’s not is because decimal numbers are based on 10. The .7 really means <m>\frac{7}{10}</m>. But inches are based on 12. Seven inches means <me>7''=\frac{7}{12}=7 \div 12 = .58333\ldots \approx .6</me> We wanted .7 so that’s not it. Our answer of 8" worked just fine since <me>8" = \frac{8}{12} = 8 \div 12 = .66666\ldots \approx .7</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What about the diver’s speed? During the first .2 seconds we calculated her speed as 4.4 meters per second. How fast is that? We can certainly convert to feet per second. <me>\frac{4.4 \text{ \cancel{meters}}}{\text{second}} \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{  \cancel{meter}}} = 4.4 \times 3.281 = \frac{14.4364 \text{ feet}}{\text{second}}</me> Does that help us understand how fast she’s going? Maybe a little. But, we’re probably most familiar with speeds measured in miles per hour, that’s what <term>mph</term> stands for.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s convert to miles per hour. First, use that <me>1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}</me> to get <me>\frac{14.4364  \text{ feet}}{\text{ \cancel{second}}} \ast \frac{60 \text{  \cancel{seconds}}}{1\text{ minute}} =  14.4364 \times 60 = \frac{866.184 \text{ feet}}{\text{minute}}</me> The larger number makes sense here because she can go more feet in a minute than in just one second.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, use that <me>1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}</me> to get <me>\frac{866.184 \text{ feet}}{\text{ \cancel{minute}}}\ast  \frac{60 \text{ \cancel{minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}} = 866.184 \times 60 = \frac{ \text{51,971.04 feet}}{\text{hour}}</me> Again, the larger number makes sense because she can go more feet in an hour than in just one minute.
			</p>

			<p>
				Last, we need to convert to miles. Turns out that <me>1 \text{ mile} = \text{5,280 feet}</me> and so <me>\frac{ \text{51,971.04 \cancel{feet}}}{\text{hour}}\ast  \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\text{5,280 \cancel{feet}}} = 51,971.04 \div \text{5,280} = \frac{9.843 \text{ miles}}{\text{hour}} \approx 10 \text{ mph}.</me> This time we got a smaller number because she can go a lot fewer miles in an hour compared to feet in an hour. Notice how we needed to divide by . Numbers on top of the fraction multiply. Those on the bottom divide.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can do this entire calculation all at once. Notice how all of the units cancel to leave us with miles per hour. <me>\frac{4.4 \text{ \cancel{meters}}}{\text{\cancel{second}}} \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ \cancel{feet}}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}}  \ast \frac{60 \text{ \cancel{seconds}}}{1 \text{ \cancel{minute}}}\ast  \frac{60 \text{ \cancel{minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}}\ast  \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5,280\text{ \cancel{feet}}}</me> <me>= 4.4 \times 3.281 \times 60 \times 60 \div \text{5,280} = 9.843 \text{ mph} \approx 10 \text{ mph}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Right before the diver hit the water she was going around 7.25 meters per second. How fast is that in mph? Ready for it all in one line? Here it is.
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\frac{7.25 \text{ \cancel{meters}}}{\text{\cancel{second}}} \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ \cancel{feet}}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}}  \ast \frac{60 \text{ \cancel{seconds}}}{1 \text{ \cancel{minute}}}\ast  \frac{60 \text{ \cancel{minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}}\ast  \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5,280\text{ \cancel{feet}}}</me> <me>=7.25 \times 3.281 \times 60 \times 60 \div 5,280 = 16.2185\ldots \approx 16 \text{ mph}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				If you’re having trouble setting up unit conversions, remember to write down the units so you can see how they cancel. If you can’t remember a number for a unit conversion, like feet for one mile, try searching online.

				Tara is working on a big project at work. She wants to back up her files to her online drop box. The site says she has 72 GB of memory remaining. Tara has about 200 files at an average of 42.3 MB each that she would like to upload. Will she have room?
			</p>

			<p>
				To answer Tara’s question we need to know that GB is short for <q>gigabyte</q> and MB is short for <q>megabyte.</q> A <term>byte</term> is a very small unit of computer memory storage space just enough for about one letter. You may have heard the word <q>mega</q> used to mean <q>really big.</q> There’s a reason for that. <term>Mega</term> is short for 1 million. That’s pretty big. But <term>giga</term> stands for 1 billion, so that’s even bigger. (Maybe it’s time for a gigamall?)
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><term>mega</term></cell>

			<p>
				What all this means is Tara has <me>72\text{ GB} = 72 \text{ billion bytes} = \text{72,000,000,000 bytes}</me> of memory remaining. She would like to save 200 files at 42.3 MB each which comes to <me>200 \times 42.3 = \text{8,460 MB}</me> which is really <me>\text{8,460 MB} = \text{8,460 million bytes} = \text{8,460,000,000} \text{ bytes}</me> Finding it hard to compare all those zeros? Try this. <me>\text{8,460 MB} = \text{8,460,000,000 bytes} = 8.46 \text{ GB } &lt; 9 \text{ GB}</me> So Tara wants to store less than 9 GB of information and she has 72 GB remaining. She has plenty of room. Save away.
			</p>

			<p>
				Tara also needs to download about 700 MB of rather high quality photos. Her computer downloads photos at 187 kbps. How long will it take? (And does she have time to run for a coffee?) The mysterious <term>kbps</term> stands for kilobits (Kb) per second. Like mega and giga, the word <q>kilo</q> stands for a large number, in this case .

				Back to Tara. Her download speed is 187 kilobits per second.

\ast \frac{1 \text{ \cancel{minute}}}{60 \text{ \cancel{seconds}}} 
\ast \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ \cancel{minutes}}}</me> <me>= 29,946.524\ldots \div 60 \div 60 = 8.318\ldots \approx 8.32 \text{ hours}</me> It will take Tara over 8 hours to download those photos. Perhaps Tara should compress the photos into a zip file or use lower resolution or find a way to download faster. Or, she can just set it up to download overnight.

			<p>
				Quick note. The <term>metric system of measurement</term>, or <term>international system of units (ISU)</term>, is the official system of nearly all countries, the United States being a notable exception. Science, international trade, and most international sporting events like the Olympics are based in the metric system. In the United States system (known officially at the <term>British system</term> or, since the British stopped using it, the <term>imperial system of measurement</term>), we have all sorts of difficult to remember conversions. One notable feature of the metric system is that most units come in sizes ranging from small to large: the <term>(metric) prefixes</term> like kilo, mega, or giga tell us which size.
			</p>

			<p>
				Really large numbers, like , are awkward to read and awkward to work with. We have seen how metric prefixes allow us to rewrite these large numbers in a way that’s much easier both to read and to work with. There’s another option that’s used often in the sciences (and by your calculator). To explain it we need to understand powers of 10.
			</p>

			<p>
				Perhaps you know what happens when we multiply a number by 10, like <m>5 \times 10 = 50</m> or, more appropriate to our example, <me>8.46 \times 10 = 84.6</me> The effect of multiplying by 10 is to move the decimal point one place to the right. When we multiply by we get <m>5 \times \text{1,000} = \text{5,000}</m> or, for our example, <me>8.46 \times \text{1,000} = \text{8,460}</me> The effect of multiplying by is to move the decimal point three places to the right. The connection is that <me>10 \times 10 \times 10  =\text{1,000}</me> Each <m>\times 10</m> has the effect of moving the decimal point one place to the right so <m>\times \text{1,000}</m> has the same effect as multiplying by 10 three times, so the decimal point moves three places to the right. That means <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{8,460,000,000} &amp; = &amp; 8.46 \underbrace{\hbox{$\times 10 \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10  \times 10 $}}_{\hbox{\begin{tiny} 9 times \end{tiny}}}  \\  %HSPACE
&amp; = &amp; 8.46 \ast 10^ 9 \\  
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Since we’re multiplying by the same number (10) over and over again, it’s easier to use <term>exponential notation</term>. Here 10 is the <term>base</term> and 9 is the <term>exponent</term> (or <term>power</term>). In this context, the exponent is also called the <term>order of magnitude</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The point of this calculation was that <me>\text{8,460,000,000} = 8.46\ast10^9</me> This shorthand is called <term>scientific notation</term>. The base is always 10. The exponent is always a whole number. The number out front, like 8.46 in our example, is always between 1 and 10, which means there’s exactly one digit before the decimal point (and any others must come afterwards). It is customary to use <m>\times</m> instead of <m>\ast</m> in scientific notation, so we should write <me>\text{8,460,000,000} = 8.46\times10^9</me> As another example, we saw earlier that <me>\text{5,000} = 5 \times \text{1,000} = 5 \times 10^3</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Most calculators use the <m>\wedge</m> symbol for exponents, as do most computer software packages. Two other notations calculators sometimes use are <m>y^x</m> or <m>x^y</m>. Sometimes that operation is accessible through the 2nd or shift key; something like SHIFT <m>\times</m>. If you’re not sure, ask a classmate or your instructor. For practice, check that <me>5 \times 10^3 = 5 \times 10 \wedge 3 = \text{5,000} \quad \checkmark</me> Notice that the order of operations is exactly what we wanted here: <m>5 \times 10 \wedge 3</m> first raises 10 to the <m>3^{\text{rd}}</m> power and then multiplies by 5. So we can enter it all at once without needing parentheses.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s the full list of the <term>order of operations</term>, the priority ranking for arithmetic operations.
			</p>

			<p>
				We highlighted the letters PEMDAS which often helps people remember this order. (<q>Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally</q> is how I learned it.) The good news is that your calculator does the operations in exactly this order. And if you want something in a different order, all you need to do is use parentheses around quantities you want calculated first.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our large number. Enter <me>8.46 \times 10 \wedge 9=</me> What do you see? Some calculators correctly list out <m>\text{8,460,000,000}</m> while others report the number back in scientific notation, which is not particularly useful. (Sigh.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s try a number so big that (nearly) every calculator will switch to scientific notation. Enter <me>2.7\times 10 \wedge 30=</me> Look carefully at the screen. Your calculator might display something like <me>\boxed{~2.70000000 \quad \text{\begin{footnotesize}E \end{footnotesize}}~30~} \text{ \quad or \quad } \boxed{~2.70000000 \quad _{ \times \text{\begin{tiny}10 \end{tiny}}}~30~}</me> Whatever shorthand your calculator uses, you should write <me>2.7 \times 10^{30}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Interested in what that number is in our usual decimal notation? It’s <me>2, \underbrace{ \hbox{$\text{700,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000} $}}_{\hbox{\begin{tiny} decimal point moves 30 places \end{tiny}}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Enough of that. Poor Tara is pulling her hair out over this project. Well, not literally, but she is quite frustrated over how slowly the project is going. She wonders: how thick is a human hair? And, how many hairs would you need to lay out to span an inch?
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out that a typical human hair is about <m>.00012</m> meters across. Very small numbers are also awkward to read and awkward to work with. In this section, we write <m>.000~12</m> where the strange-looking space is to help you read the number. Of course, a better solution is to use metric prefixes to get more appropriate units, just as we did for large numbers.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, <term>centi</term> is short for 1 in a hundred, or <m>.01</m>. Not surprising since one cent is $.01, or one percent is 1%=.01. That’s the same word <q>centi</q> as in centimeter (about inch) and there’s good reason for that as
			</p>

			<p>
				What about that human hair? It is convenient to measure in micrometers using that <me>1 \text{ meter} = \text{1,000,000 micrometers}</me> The width of a human hair in micrometers (abbreviated <m>\mu m</m> in the sciences) is <me>.000~12 \text{ \cancel{meters} } \ast \frac{\text{1,000,000 } \mu \text{m}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}} =  .000~12 \times \text{1,000,000} = 120 \mu \text{m}</me> The <m>\mu</m> symbol is the Greek letter <em>mu</em>, but we’ll just read <m>\mu m</m> as micrometers.
			</p>

			<p>
				To answer Tara’s question about how many hairs in an inch, we recall that <me>1 \text{ inch} \approx 2.54 \text{ cm}</me> where cm is short for centimeter. Ready to convert? <me>1 \text{ \cancel{inch}} \ast \frac{ 2.54 \text{ \cancel{cm}} }{1 \text{ \cancel{inch}}}
\ast \frac{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}}{100 \text{ \cancel{cm}}} 
\ast \frac{\text{1,000,000  \cancel{$\mu$m}}}{1 \text{ \cancel{meter}}} 
\ast \frac{1 \text{ hair}}{120 \text{ \cancel{$\mu$m}}}</me> <me>= 2.54 \div 100 \times \text{1,000,000} \div 120 = 211.66666\ldots \approx 200 \text{ hairs}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We can also describe really small numbers using scientific notation. Perhaps you know what happens when we divide a number by 10, like <m>50 \div 10 = 5</m> or, more appropriate to our example, <me>1.2 \div 10 = .12</me> The effect of dividing by 10 is to move the decimal point one place to the left. If we divide by instead, we get <me>1.2 \div \text{1,000,000} = .000~001~2</me> The connection is that <me>\text{1,000,000} = 10 \wedge 6</me> and so dividing by moves the decimal point six places to the left. Notice that we have to introduce zeros as placeholders.
			</p>

			<p>
				The width of a hair was .00012 meters. To get that number from 1.2, we need to move the decimal point 4 places to the left. <me>1.2 \div 10^4 = 1.2 \div \text{10,000} = .000~12</me> The shorthand for dividing by a power is to use negative exponents. For example <me>\div 10^4 = \times 10^{-4}</me> It has nothing to do with negative numbers. It’s just a shorthand. The point of this calculation was that <me>.00012= 1.2\ast10^{-4}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Once again we have scientific notation. The base is still 10. The exponent is still a whole number, although now it’s negative. The number out front, like 1.2 in our example, is still between 1 and 10, which means there’s exactly one digit before the decimal point (and any others must come afterwards). As before it customary to use <m>\times</m> instead of <m>\ast</m> in scientific notation, so we should write <me>.000~12= 1.2 \times 10^{-4}</me> When you see a number written in scientific notation, the power of 10 tells you a lot. For example, <m>6.7 \times 10^4 = 67,000</m> and <m>6.7 \times 10^{-3} = .006~7</m>. A positive power of 10 says you have a big number, and a negative power of 10 says you’re dealing with a very small number.

		<title>Equations</title>

		<p>
			For most of us the word <q>algebra</q> brings to mind equations, formulas, and all those symbols. One chapter into a book on algebra and we haven’t seen any equations. What gives?
		</p>

		<p>
			Remember, this course is all about using algebra to answer questions. Equations are going to be a very important part of that work for at least three reasons. First, equations provide a nice shorthand for describing a function. It’s much quicker to write down an equation than to make a table or graph. Second, equations help us categorize problems which, in turn, helps us know what to expect in that type of situation. Lastly, there are lots of powerful <q>symbolic</q> techniques we can use to solve problems when we have an equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			So why haven’t we used equations yet? Why did the first chapter focus on describing functions using words (verbal), tables (numeric), and graphs (graphical)? It turns out that there’s one thing equations can’t do: it’s hard to tell from an equation whether an answer makes sense in the real world. If we just worked with equations we might find an answer calling for us to produce a negative number of tables or wait 300 years for an investment to reach our payoff level, or similar nonsense.
		</p>

		<p>
			Even as we add equations to our list of tools for describing and working with functions, we will rely on words, numbers, and graphs to help evaluate the reasonableness of our answer. Thus most problems will ask you to work with all of these modes.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this chapter we introduce equations by taking a first look at the two most important types of equations – linear and exponential. Our emphasis will be on understanding where these equations arise and how to interpret them in context. Next, we work with a variety of equations, learning how to use equations and discovering general methods for approximating solutions to equations. In later chapters we will solve equations exactly (Chapter 3) and return to study linear and exponential equations each in greater depth (Chapters 4 and 5), so don’t worry if we leave a few questions unresolved for now.

			<title>A first look at linear equations</title>

			<p>
				You’re expecting family for dinner in a few hours and, wouldn’t you know it, but your kitchen sink is clogged. The bottle of drain opener didn’t clear it out. Your brother-in-law has offered to help, but last time he tried he only made it worse. The plumber will charge you $100 just to come to your house. In addition, there will be a charge of $75 per hour for the service. If you decide to call the plumber, what will it cost?
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, if the plumber takes one hour, then he’ll charge you $100 for showing up and $75 for the one hour of work. So, the total plumber’s bill will be <me>100 + 75 = \$175</me> For two hours, there’s still the $100 charge, but also $75 for each of the two hours. That’s an additional charge of <me>2 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} =2 \times 75= \$150</me> So, the total plumber’s bill will be <me>\$100 + \$150 = \$250</me> Try this calculation all at once. <me>\$100 + 2 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = 100 + 2 \times 75 = \$250</me> Let’s hope it wouldn’t take the plumber as long as three hours, but if it did, we can do a similar calculation. Add the fixed charge of $100 to the additional charge of $75 for each of the three hours. The plumber’s bill would be <me>\$100 + 3 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = 100 + 3 \times 75 = \$325</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What would it cost if the plumber takes only <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> hour? The plumber’s bill would be <me>\$100 + \frac{1}{2} \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} =100 + .5 \times 75  = \$100 + \$37.50 = \$137.50</me> Notice we used <m>\frac{1}{2}=1 \div 2 = .5</m>. Bet you knew that.
			</p>

			<p>
				What would happen if the plumber was taking so long that before he got there you dumped another bottle of drain opener in the sink and that did the trick. But before you could call and cancel the plumber, wouldn’t you know it, there he was. What do you owe him for that 0 hours of work? Probably $100. Unless your plumber says to <q>forget it.</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				We see that the plumber’s charge depends on the amount of time it takes to unclog the sink. We can name these variables.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each time we knew how long the plumber spent and calculated the plumber’s bill <m>P</m> by starting with the trip charge of $100 and adding in $75 times the number of hours. For example, for 3 hours we calculated <me>\$100 + 3 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}} = \$325</me> We have a name for the number of hours in general; it is <m>T</m>. So for <m>T</m> hours, we would calculate <me>\$100 + T \text{ hours} \ast \frac{\$75}{\text{hour}}=P</me> See how we just put the <m>P</m> in for $325 and <m>T</m> where the 3 hours was? We’re just generalizing from our example. Drop the units and we have our equation. If the plumber works for <m>T</m> hours, then the cost is $<m>P</m> where <me>P = 100 + T \ast 75</me> We started the equation <q><m>P=</m></q> because it is a convention to begin equations with the dependent variable, when possible.
			</p>

			<p>
				An <term>equation</term> is a formula that shows how the value of the dependent variable (like <m>P</m>) depends on the value of the independent variable (like <m>T</m>). We usually write an equation in the form <me>\text{dep} = \text{formula involving indep}</me> The equation is another way to describe a function, and efficient one – an equation carries a lot of information in only a few symbols.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a mathematical convention that we write numbers before letters in an equation. So, instead of <m>T \ast 75</m> we should write <m>75 \ast T</m>. There’s a conventional shorthand for this product: when a number and letter are next to each other, it means that they are multiplied. So, instead of <m>75 * T</m> we should write <m>75T</m>. Thus our equation is normally written as <me>P = 100 + 75T.</me> You’ll have to remember the hidden multiplication when you’re calculating.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you wanted to write the equation as <me>P = 75T + 100,</me> that would be okay too. We can add the $100 trip charge first, like we did in our examples, or at the end. Same answer.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose the plumber shows up at your house and fixed the sink in 25 minutes. Whew! No sooner do you pay your bill than your first dinner guest arrives. How much do you owe the plumber? Notice that <me>25 \text{ minutes} \ast \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 25 \div 60 = .4166666\ldots \text{ hours}</me> Therefore for 25 minutes we have <m>T \approx .4166 \text{ hours}</m>
			</p>

			<p>
				Using our equation we get <me>P = 100 + 75\ast .4166 = 100 + 75 \times {.4166} = 131.245 \approx \$131.25.</me> It was important that we rounded off our final answer because we had rounded off to get .4166 along the way. We could have done the entire calculation at once (avoiding the round off error) as <me>100 + 75 \times 25 \div 60 =131.25</me> Either way, we owe the plumber $131.25.
			</p>

			<p>
				If we plot the points from the table of values in a graph, we see that the points lie on a line. In Chapter 1 we highlighted the points from our table on the graph. It is more common to just show the smooth curve or line.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='Plumber.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Why is the graph a line? Remember that the rate of change tells us how steep the graph is. For example, let’s find the rate of change between 1 hour and 2 hours. <me>\text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$250 - \$175}{2 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour}} = \frac{\$75}{1 \text{ hour}} = \$75 \text{ per hour}</me> Sure! We knew that. The plumber charges an extra $75 for each extra hour he works. The rate of change is precisely $75/hour, no matter where we calculate it. Since the rate of change is constant, the graph is the same steepness everywhere. So, the graph is a line, and the function is <term>linear</term>. Another way to say this is a function with constant rate of change is <term>linear</term>. The plumber’s total charge is a linear function of time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Look back at our equation. <me>P = 100 + 75T</me> Any linear equation fits this template.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice our two variables are in our equation and there are two constants. Each constant has its own meaning. The first constant is 100 and it is measured in dollars. It is the trip charge, the fixed amount we would owe the plumber even if he does 0 hours work. In our standard form we refer to this quantity as the <term>starting value</term> (or <term>start</term> for short), but it’s official name is <term>intercept</term>. On the graph it’s where the line crosses the vertical axis. Think of a football player (running along the vertical axis) intercepting a pass (coming in the line). We can find the intercept from our equation by plugging in <m>T = 0</m> so that <me>P = 100 + 75 \times 0 = 100</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				The second constant is 75 and though its tempting to say it is measured in dollars, it is really measured in $ per hour. This number is the rate of change and in the context of linear equations it gets its own name too. Its called the <term>slope</term>. Since the rate of change measures the steepness of any curve or line, the word <q>slope</q>, like mountain slope, makes sense. In our plumber example the intercept was $100 and the slope was $75/hour.

The position turned out to be a great fit for her, and after one year she was promoted to data analyst with a 15% raise. The next year Joceyln was promoted again, to senior data analyst along with a 21% raise. <q>Not bad,</q> her friend Audun said, <q>a 36% raise in two years.</q> But Jocelyn quickly corrected him. <q>Audun, it’s even better than that! It’s over 39%</q>
			</p>

			<p>
				After the first year, Jocelyn’s salary of $ was increased by 15%. Remember that means 15% of $28,000 more. To calculate 15% of $ we multiply using the decimal form <me>15\% = \frac{15}{100} = 15 \div 100 = .15</me> to get <me>15\% \text{ of  28,000} = .15 \times \text{28,000} = \text{4,200}</me> That’s how much Jocelyn’s raise was that first year. By adding that amount to the original salary we get <me>\text{28,000} + \text{4,200} = \text{32,200}</me> After one year Jocelyn’s salary was $32,200.
			</p>

			<p>
				After the second year, Jocelyn got a 21% raise. This means her rose by 21% from what it was just before the raise, that is, from the $. (The 21% does not refer back to the original $ value.) So, to calculate the increase, we take 21% of $, which is <me>21\% \text{ of  \$32,200} = .21 \times \text{32,200} = \text{\$6,762}</me> By adding on this raise we get <me>\text{32,200}+ \text{6,762} = \text{38,962}</me> After the second year Jocelyn was earning $.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Jocelyn’s original salary was $, the net increase in her salary is the difference <me>\text{\$38,962} - \text{\$28,000} = \text{\$10,962}</me> The corresponding percentage increase was <me>\frac{\text{10,962}}{\text{28,000}}= \text{10,962} \div \text{28,000} = .3915 = .3915 \times 100\% = 39.15\%</me> As Jocelyn said, that’s over 39% increase.
			</p>

			<p>
				What’s going on here? Audun thought that 15% and 21% would be 36% because <m>15 + 21 = 36</m>. The reason it doesn’t work that was is that while the 15% is of the original $, the 21% was actually calculated on the $. So, we can’t just combine percentages by adding.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each time we figured out Jocelyn’s salary, we did a two-step process. First, we calculated the amount of the increase and second, we found the new value by adding on. There’s actually an easier way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Jocelyn’s salary was $28,000 and then went up by 15%. For her new salary we want to add her old salary (all of it) plus 15%. So we want 100% plus 15%, or 115% of her old salary. That works in general. When we increase a number by 15%, we end up with 100% of what we started with plus 15% more, for a grand total of 115% of what we started with. So we can just multiply by 1.15, which is 115% written in decimal, since <me>115\% = \frac{115}{100} = 115 \div 100 = 1.15</me> Looks weird, works great.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means all we have to do to find Jocelyn’s salary is <me>\text{28,000} \times 1.15 = \text{32,200}</me> We can do the same thing for the next calculation <me>\text{32,200} \times 1.21 = \text{38,962}</me> Here we multiplied by 1.21 because after a 21% increase you have 121% of what you started with. And 121% in decimal form is just 1.21.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now hang on to your hat, because we can combine these parts together. In our example, we started with $. Then we multiplied by 1.15, which gave us $. And then we multiplied that answer by 1.21, to get our final answer of $. So really we just did <me>\text{28,000} \times 1.15 \times 1.21 = \text{38,962}</me> Same answer. A lot less effort. And, check it out <me>1.15 \times 1.21 = 1.3915 =139.15\%</me> That’s where the 39.15% increase is hidden. Cool.
			</p>

			<p>
				A little terminology before we move on. A percentage increase is known as the <term>growth rate</term> and the number we multiply in the one-step method is called the <term>growth factor</term>. For example, in calculating 15% increase, the growth rate was <m>15\%=.15</m> in decimal, and so the growth factor was <me>115\%=1.15</me> If you’re into formulas here it is.
			</p>

			<p>
				We had <m>r=.15</m> and so <me>g=1+r=1+.15=1.15</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Jocelyn’s most recent assignment has been analyzing information on rising health care costs. In 2007 the United States spent $2.26 trillion on health care. Written out with all its zeros that’s <me>\$2.26 \text{ trillion} =  \text{\$2,260,000,000,000}</me> Health care costs were projected to increase at an average of 6.7% annually. That means we have <me>r= 6.7\% = .067</me> and <me>g=1+r=1+.067=1.067</me> So, to find the effect of a 6.7% increase, we can just multiply by 1.067. Again, that’s the 100% of what we started with plus 6.7% more for a grand total of <m>106.7\%= 1.067</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are ready to do some examples. In 2007 the United States spent $2.26 trillion on health care. The projection for one year later is <me>2.26 \times 1.067 = 2.41142 \approx \$2.41 \text{ trillion}</me> Another year later, projected health care costs are <me>2.41  \times 1.067 = 2.57147 \approx \$2.57 \text{ trillion}</me> And so on. For each year we multiply by another 1.067.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, by 2017 (ten years later), health care costs are projected to be <me>2.26 \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067  \times 1.067</me> I don’t know about you, but I would rather not type that all into a calculator. Luckily, multiplying by 1.067 ten times is the same as multiplying by <m>1.067^{10}</m>. Recall that the <term>base</term> <m>1.067</m> is the number we multiply by and the <term>exponent</term> (or <term>power</term>) <m>10</m> tells us how many times. So we can calculate <me>2.26  \ast 1.067^{10} = 2.26 \times 1.067 \wedge 10  
= 4.322675488 \approx \$ 4.32 \text{ trillion}</me> Notice that the order of operations is exactly what we wanted here: first raise 1.067 to the 10<m>^{\text{th}}</m> power, then multiply by 2.26. So we can enter it all at once without needing parentheses. Bottom line: health care costs are expected to be around $4.32 trillion by the year 2017. Oh my!
			</p>

			<p>
				We’re so close to the equation now, we can smell it. Our variables are
			</p>

			<p>
				We just found the cost after 10 years was <me>\text{\$2.26}  \ast 1.067^{10}\approx \$4.32 \text{ trillion}</me> We can generalize to get the equation by putting in <m>Y</m> (instead of 10) and <m>H</m> for the (instead of $4.32 trillion). When we do we get <me>\text{2.26}  \ast 1.067^{Y} = H</me> Rewriting the equation to begin with the dependent variable we get <me>H = 2.26\ast 1.067^{Y}</me> By the way, there are two other standard ways of writing this equation <me>H= 2.26(1.067)^{Y} \quad \text{ and } \quad H = 2.26\left(1.067^{Y}\right)</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, in 2027 we have <m>Y=2027 - 2007 = 20</m> years and our equation projects health care cost at <me>2.26 \ast 1.067^{20} = 2.26 \times 1.067 \wedge 20 = 8.821882053 \approx \$8.82 \text{ trillion}</me> Not sure it’s realistic to expect that steady an increase for 20 years, but that is what the equation projects, so let’s work with it for now.
			</p>

				What does the graph of this function look like? Here are the values we found so far. That should be enough.

			<p>
				Can you see that the graph curves slightly? It’s not a line. That’s because this function isn’t linear.
			</p>

			<p>
				Look back at our equation <me>H = 2.26\ast 1.067^{Y}</me> This type of equation is called an <term>exponential equation</term> because the independent variable is in the exponent. Any exponential equation fits this template.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice our two variables are in our equation and there are two constants. Each constant has its own meaning. The first constant is 2.26 and it is measured in trillions of dollars. It is the amount spent on health care in the starting year of 2007. In our standard form we refer to this quantity as the <term>starting value</term> (or <term>start</term> for short). As with linear equations, it’s official name is <term>intercept</term> and it’s the value where the curve crosses the vertical axis on the graph.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second constant is the growth factor 1.067, and is the decimal equivalent of the 106.7%. The growth factor for an exponential equation is similar to the slope of a linear equation because both tell us how fast the function is increasing. But the slope measures the rate of change – how much is added at each step, while the growth factor corresponds to the percent increase. Another way to say that is linear functions correspond to situations where we are adding the same amount each time and exponential functions correspond to situations where we are adding the same percentage each time (or, equivalently, multiplying by the same amount each time).
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes the graph of an exponential equation looks a lot like a line, especially if you only plot a few points. So, be sure to plot five or more points to see the curve in the graph of an exponential equation.

			<title>Using equations</title>

			<p>
				The Cadillac Escalade is a cross between a sports utility vehicle (SUV) and luxury car. Either way, it’s a big car. And it takes awhile to stop. One study showed that the 2010 Escalade traveling at 60 miles per hour takes about 144 feet to come to a complete stop from when the driver first hits the brakes. In fact, the braking distance of any car depends on how fast it is going. If someone is driving slowly they can stop in shorter distance than if they are driving fast. Which is why you should drive slowly on residential streets.
			</p>

			<p>
				We would like to be able to calculate the braking distances at other speeds, so our two variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>S=</m> speed (mph) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">

				</row>

			<p>
				Using the data and equations from physics, automobile analysts were able to determine that the equation relating these two variables is <me>B=.04S^2</me> Remember that the .04 written next to the <m>S^2</m> means they are multiplied. We might equally well have written <me>B = .04 \ast S^2</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				You may be a little surprised to see the variable <m>S</m> <term>squared</term> (raised to the 2nd power) or wonder what the number .04 means. This equation is not something we can figure out because it relies both on the data and knowledge of the physics involved. But, we can still work with this equation to find the braking distances at any speed. (If you must know, this equation is only approximate since things like tire and road conditions are a factor, but for what we want it is good enough.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Although in the last couple of sections we were able to find equations by generalizing examples, there are actually many different mathematical and statistical techniques for finding equations. A scientist might use lab experiments and some theory to figure it out. An economist might recognize that the equation fits a certain template because of the underlying economics. A store manager might know from years of experience that a certain equation works well to predict sales. It can be comforting to know where an equation comes from but whether we find an equation for ourselves or get it from an expert, we can use it to answer our questions and make predictions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have an equation we should check the reported stopping distance at 60 mph. We have <m>S=60</m> so we substitute 60 in place of <m>S</m> in the equation to get <me>B = .04 \ast 60^2 = .04 \times \underline{60} \wedge 2 = 144 \text{ feet} \quad \checkmark</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick bit of terminology. When we know the independent variable, like <m>S=60</m> and we substitute into the equation to find the dependent variable, like <m>B</m>, we say we <term>evaluate</term> the function <m>B</m> at <m>S=60</m>. You might have noticed that the 60 was underlined in the calculation above. In this book we underline the value of the independent variable when we are evaluating. That way it’s easier to see which numbers come from the equation and which number we’re plugging in. Feel free to do the same. Or not.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s use our equation to calculate the braking distance for a Cadillac Escalade traveling 30, 50, 70 or 90 miles per hour. For 30 miles per hour, we have <m>S=30</m>. So, we evaluate at <m>S=30</m> to get <me>B = .04 \ast 30^2 = .04\times \underline{30} \wedge 2 = 36 \text{ feet}</me> At 30 mph, it takes the Cadillac Escalade 36 feet to stop. As we expected, it doesn’t take nearly as far to stop as it did at 60 mph. For the other speeds we do the same thing: evaluate at the appropriate value of <m>S</m>. When <m>S=50</m> mph we get <me>B = .04 \ast 50^2 = .04\times \underline{50}\wedge2 = 100 \text{ feet}</me> When <m>S=70</m> mph we get <me>B = .04 \ast 70^2 = .04\times \underline{70}\wedge2 = 196\text{ feet}</me> When <m>S=90</m> mph we get <me>B = .04 \ast 90^2 = .04\times \underline{90}\wedge2 = 324 \text{ feet}</me> And, what does our equation tell us when the speed is 0 mph? We evaluate at <m>S=0</m> mph to get <me>B = .04 \ast 0^2 = .04\times \underline{0} \wedge 2 = 0 \text{ feet}</me> Well, sure! If the car isn’t moving, then it won’t need any distance to stop. Here’s what we’ve found so far, displayed in a table.

				My neighbor Jeff happens to drive a 2010 Cadillac Escalade. The other day he almost was in an accident on the highway. Luckily no one was hurt, but he had to slam on the brakes to stop. The police report mentioned they believe it took his car 183 feet to stop. Jeff says he was not driving over the posted speed limit of 65 mph. Should we believe him?
			</p>

			<p>
				We can see from the table that braking distance of 183 feet falls in between the 144 and 196 on our table which leads us to believe that Jeff was traveling faster than 60 mph and slower than 70 mph. We can figure out if Jeff were driving at 65 mph, then his braking distance would have been <me>B = .04 \ast 65^2 = .04\times \underline{65} \wedge 2 = 169 \text{ feet}</me> That’s less than the 183 feet Jeff took to stop. So, it appears that Jeff was driving faster than 65 mph.
			</p>

			<p>
				But wait a minute. The braking distance is just the time it takes from when the driver’s foot hits the brake until the car stops. That distance doesn’t take into account the driver’s reaction time – how long between when the driver thinks to stop and when the driver’s foot actually hits the brake. We have a new dependent variable
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>D=</m> total stopping distance (feet) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>S=</m> speed (mph) <m>\sim</m> indep <em>as before</em></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				How can we include this reaction time into an equation? Suppose it takes 1 second to react. We would like to know how many feet that adds to the equation. This is something we can figure out. We know the speed and the time, so multiply them to get the distance, right? One small snag: the speed is in mph (miles per hour). We need to convert units. <me>1 \text{ \cancel{sec}} \ast \frac{1 \text{ \cancel{min}}}{60 \text{ \cancel{sec}}} \ast \frac{1 \text{ hour}}{60 \text{ \cancel{min}}} \ast \frac{\text{5,280 feet}}{1 \text{ mile}}=1 \div 60 \div 60 \times \text{5,280}= 1.4666\ldots \approx 1.47 \text{ feet per mph}</me> added to the stopping distance. Notice the fancy fraction work with the units? <me>\frac{\text{hour}\ast \text{feet}}{\text{mile}}=\frac{\text{feet}}{\quad \frac{\text{miles}}{\text{hour}}\quad~}=\frac{\text{feet}}{\text{mph}}</me> What all this mess means is that we should add 1.47 feet for every mph of speed. So <m>S</m> mph adds <m>1.47\ast S</m> feet to the stopping distance. Long story short, our new equation is <me>D=.04S^2+1.47S</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Something interesting about this equation. The independent variable <m>S</m> appears twice; first for the braking distance and again because of the reaction time. When we evaluate the equation we need to plug in the value of <m>S</m> in two places. Check it out. When <m>S=30</m> mph we have <me>D =  .04 \ast  30^2 + 1.47 \ast 30 = .04\times \underline{30} \wedge 2 +1.47 \times \underline{30} = 80.10 \approx 80 \text{ feet}</me> That’s a lot further than just the braking distance of 36 feet. When <m>S=50</m> mph we have <me>D = .04 \ast  50^2 +1.47\ast 50 =  .04\times \underline{50} \wedge 2 +1.47\times \underline{50} = 173.50 \approx 174 \text{ feet}</me> again, much more than the braking distance of 100 feet. Here’s the revised table of values.

				These numbers make us rethink Jeff’s assertion. Given that he stopped in 183 feet, which is much less than the 232 feet it takes to stop at 60 mph, it looks like Jeff was driving less than 60 mph. To be sure, calculate that at 65 mph, it would have taken Jeff <me>D = .04 \ast  65^2 + 1.47 \ast  65  = .04\times \underline{65} \wedge 2+ 1.47\times \underline{65} =264.55 \approx 265 \text{ feet}</me> Again, we should believe Jeff. And, be glad nobody was hurt.
			</p>

			<p>
				A quick glance at the graph confirms our findings.

			<p>
				The distance of 183 feet falls just above the unlabeled gridline for 175 and below the gridline for 200. Looking at the corresponding point on the braking distance curve, it looks like it falls around 67 mph, but looking at the corresponding point on the stopping distance curve, it looks like just over 50 mph.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, our first equation <me>B = .04 \ast S^2</me> is a <term>power equation</term> because the independent variable is being raised to a power, <m>n=2</m>, and then scaled by a <term>proportionality constant</term>, <m>k=.04</m>. Any power equation fits this template.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our second equation <me>D=.04S^2 + 1.47S</me> is a <term>polynomial equation</term> because includes both a linear and powers. The exercises introduce more polynomial equations. Polynomials can have any powers, but in this equation the highest power happens to be 2. This type of polynomial equation has a special name. It is a <term>quadratic equation</term>. Any quadratic equation fits this template.
			</p>

			<p>
				For our equation <m>a=.04</m>, <m>b=1.47</m>, and the mysteriously missing <m>c=0</m>.

										The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe 4WD will take about 158.1 feet to stop when traveling at 60 mph in normal highway conditions.

										Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10’<m>\times</m>25’ vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. (Remember ’ stands for <q>feet,</q> so the garden is 10 feet wide and 25 feet long.) One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.

															Actually, they aren’t sure how wide the path should be and how much gravel they can get. Let’s write <m>W</m> = width of path (feet) and <m>G</m> = amount of gravel (cubic feet).

				Which country on Earth has the most people? If you guess China and India, in that order, you’d be right. And by a lot compared to other countries. A very distant third is the United States, with several countries close on our heels. Here are the population and growth rates estimates made in 2011.

				India’s population is growing fastest of these top three, so let’s take a closer look. In the exercises you can explore China and other countries. Let’s tackle this question: when is India’s population projected to pass 1.5 billion?
			</p>

			<p>
				Start by writing an equation. The variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>P=</m> population of India (billion people) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>

					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>Y=</m> time (years since 2011) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Since there is a fixed percentage growth, or at least that’s what we’re assuming, the population grows exponentially. The template for an exponential equation is <me>\text{dep} = \text{start} \ast \text{growth factor} ^ {\text{indep}}</me> For India’s population, we know that the growth rate is <me>r=1.31\% = \frac{1.31}{100} = 1.31 \div 100 = .0131</me> so the corresponding growth factor is <me>g=1+r=1+.0131=1.0131</me> We also know that the starting population is 1.205 billion in 2011. We’re good to go. The equation is <me>P = 1.205 \ast 1.0131^Y</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We want to know when India’s population will pass 1.5 billion people. That means we are looking for the value of <m>Y</m> that corresponds to <m>P=1.5</m>. That answer is called the <term>solution</term> of our equation. In other words, a solution to an equation is the value of the independent variable we plug in to get the desired value of the dependent variable. It’s not always easy to <em>find</em> a solution; but it’s easy to <em>check</em> – just evaluate.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since we can easily check and see if any number is a solution, one way to find the solution is to <term>guess and check</term>. Let’s try that to determine when India’s population will pass 1.5 billion people. Since we’re not sure where to start, let’s see what the equation projects for 2012, when <m>Y=1</m>. <me>P=1.205 \ast 1.0131^1 = 1.205 \times 1.0131 \wedge \underline{1} = 1.2208096... \approx 1.221 \text{ billion}</me> Hardly budged. Well, comparatively.
			</p>

			<p>
				What about in 5 years? The corresponding population is <me>P=1.205 \ast 1.0131^5 = 1.205 \times 1.0131 \wedge \underline{5} = 1.28614961\approx  1.286\text{ billion}</me> Less than 1.5 billion. Let’s try <m>Y=10</m>. The equation gives us <me>P=1.205 \ast 1.0131^{10} = 1.205 \times 1.0131 \wedge \underline{10} = 1.37276417 \approx 1.373 \text{ billion}</me> Still much less than 1.5 billion
			</p>

			<p>
				This is going slowly. We would really like to find a point at which the equation gives us more than 1.5 billion. Then we can work backwards from there to narrow things down. How about 50 years? <me>P=1.205 \ast 1.0131^{50} = 1.205 \times 1.0131 \wedge \underline{50} = 2.31223244  \approx 2.312\text{ billion}</me> That’s too much, but the good news is now we know the solution is between 10 years and 50 years.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s summarize what we have so far in a table. Notice how we’ve added a third row to keep track of our progress for our goal.

				We know the solution is between 10 and 50 years, and it seems closer to 10, so let’s guess 20 years. In 20 years, the population should be around 1.564 billion. Where’s that 1.564 from? Just our equation again. It would be good practice for you to evaluate at <m>Y=20</m> to check.
			</p>

			<p>
				The 10 year estimate is too low and the 20 year estimate is too high. That means the solution is between 10 years and 20 years, so let’s split the difference and guess 15 years which gives 1.465 billion. (Check again, for practice.) Ooooh, we’re getting close. The population should pass 1.5 billion some time between 15 and 20 years, and likely closer to 15 so let’s guess 17 years. Estimate is 1.504 billion. Would 16 years have been enough? That gives 1.484 billion, not quite enough. Let’s add these numbers to our table.

				According to our equation, the population of the India should pass 1.5 billion after 17 years, which would be in the year 2028. By the way, it works to add the year and number. <me>2011 + 17 \text{ years } = 2028</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				The strategy we used to find the solution of our equation is <term>successive approximation</term>. Essentially it’s just the guess and check method, but it’s called <q>successive</q> because we’re trying to get a closer guess each time. Typically once we have a value that’s too big and one that’s too small, we guess a value in between (for example, their average). This sort of splitting the difference method of guessing is a rough version of the <term>bisection method</term>. Now you know.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might be surprised that you’re supposed to guess the solution at this point in the course. I mean, in the beginning of the course we didn’t have equations, just tables and graphs, and so guessing was all we had to work with. But now we have actual equations, right? In previous courses your instructor or textbook might have emphasized getting the <q>exact</q> solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s why it’s different in this course. First, in almost every story in this book the numbers in the problem are approximations, or at least rounded off. If you start with approximations, no matter how exact your mathematics is, the solutions will still be approximate. Second, even if our numbers started out precisely exact, chances are that the equation is only approximating reality. Do we really know what the population growth rate will be in India over the next twenty years? And, if the equation is just approximate, then no matter how exact the numbers or the mathematics, the solution will again still be approximate. Last, and this is good news – we really just want approximations. Do you really need to know that a sandwich has 427.2889 calories? Isn’t 430 calories close enough? (Sound familiar? These ideas were discussed in more detail in the prelude on approximation, before Section 1.1.)
			</p>

			<p>
				In previous mathematics courses you may have seen ways to solve equations <q>exactly,</q> and we will talk about those methods in the next chapters of this text. It is true that successive approximations can taking a long time and, because of that, is a bit annoying. Solving techniques we’ll learn later are much, much quicker.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two important reasons for using successive approximations, even if you know quicker solving techniques. First, the method of successive approximations works in most situations for any type of equation. Solving methods that we will see later on just work for one type of an equation or another – one technique for linear equations, a different technique for exponential equations, etc. That’s a lot of different methods to know. Second, even if you’re going to use a formal equation-solving technique to solve a problem it’s a good habit to guess-and-check a bit first to make sure your solution is reasonable. It is easy to make mistakes when using those formal techniques. Remember,

				It looks like 1.5 billion corresponds to just before the unlabeled gridline halfway between 15 and 20. That line would be 17.5, so the answer of 17 (which was year 2028) looks perfect.

			<title>Finance formulas</title>

			<p>
				Hector is trying to figure out his finances – finding a good investment for his tax refund, saving for a down payment on a house, and dealing with his student loans. While there are various online tools that will <q>do the math</q> for him, Hector would really like to work out the formulas for himself.
			</p>

			<p>
				First that tax refund. What a relief: $ back this year. Much as Hector is tempted to spend the money on something fun, he knows he should save it. His local bank offers him two choices: a savings account paying 1.2% interest compounded monthly or a 3-year certificate of deposit paying 3% interest compounded monthly.
			</p>

			<p>
				The description <term>compounded monthly</term> means that the bank will pay him of the annual interest each month, and then use that new balance in computing his interest in the month that follows. For example, that savings account would pay 1.2% interest compounded monthly, so that’s <me>\frac{1.2\%}{12}= 1.2\% \div 12 = .1\%</me> interest each month. Rather than figuring out Hector’s balance one month at a time, we can use this formula.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you’re curious, this equation fits the template for an exponential equation. <me>\text{dep} = \text{start} \ast \text{growth factor} ^ {\text{indep}}</me> The starting amount is <m>p</m>. The annual growth rate is <m>r</m>, which means the monthly growth rate is <m>\frac{r}{12}</m>, and so the monthly growth factor is <me>g=1+\frac{r}{12}</me> Since the interest is added each month, it would make sense to measure time in months. It is customary, however, to measure time in years instead. No big deal. After 3 years, for example, we have <me>3 \text{ \cancel{years}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ months}}{1\text{ \cancel{year}}} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ months}</me> Yup, just multiply the years by 12 to get the months. In the general formula, the number of years is <m>y</m> and so the number of months is <m>12y</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s figure out how much Hector would have in his account for each choice. For the savings account we have <m>p=\$\text{1,040}</m>, <m>r=1.2\% = 1.2 \div 100 = .012</m>, and <m>y = 3</m> years so we use the <alert>Compound Interest Formula</alert> to get <me>\begin{aligned}
a &amp; = &amp;  p \left( 1 + \frac{r}{12}\right) ^{12y}\\
&amp; = &amp;   \text{1,040} \left( 1 + \frac{.012}{12}\right) ^{12\ast 3}\\
&amp; =  &amp;  \text{1,040} \times ( 1 + .012 \div 12 ) \wedge (12 \times 3) \\
&amp; =  &amp; 1078.10269\ldots  \approx \$\text{1,078.10} 
\end{aligned}</me> See the parentheses? The parentheses around the base were already in the equation. They make sure that the inside quantity gets calculated before it’s raised to the power. We inserted the parentheses around the exponent to override the order of operations again. This time we wanted the product (<m>12 \times 3=36</m>) calculated first.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, Hector might want to choose that certificate of deposit instead. That pays 3% interest compounded monthly, so the only change is <m>r=3\% = 3 \div 100 = .03</m>. Your turn. Check that using the <alert>Compound Interest Formula</alert> you get $.
			</p>

			<p>
				It looks like the certificate of deposit is a clear winner, but there is a catch. If Hector wants his money before the three year term is up, he loses all (or most) of the interest earned. Ouch. So Hector should decide not only based on what the accounts pay: $1,078.10 in the savings account versus $1,137.81 in the certificate of deposit, but also on whether he is comfortable leaving the money alone for three years or not.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unimpressed by the $59.71 difference and uncomfortable locking his money in for that long, Hector decides on the savings account. When he reads the account information carefully he is surprised to see the account pays <q>1.207% APR.</q> What does that mean?
			</p>

			<p>
				The acronymn <term>APR</term> stands for <term>annual percentage rate</term>. It means that 1.2% interest compounded monthly has the same net effect as paying 1.207% at the end of each year. where does that number come from? Imagine $1 in the account (<m>p=1</m>) for one year (<m>y=1</m>) with at 1.2% interest (so <m>r=.012</m> again). Silly, yes, but watch what we learn. The balance from the <alert>Compound Interest Formula</alert> would be around $1.01207, as you can (and should) check. That means the annual growth factor is <m>g=1.01207</m> which corresponds to the equivalent of annual growth rate of <me>r=g-1=1.01207-1 = .01207 = 1.207\% \text{ APR}</me> There’s a formula for this too.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the CD pays 3% compounded monthly, so <m>r=3\% = 3 \div 100 = .03</m>. Using the <alert>Equivalent APR Formula</alert> we get <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{APR}  &amp;= &amp; \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12}-1\\
&amp; = &amp;   \left(1+\frac{.03}{12}\right)^{12}-1\\
&amp; =  &amp; ( 1 + .03 \div 12 ) \wedge 12 -1  \\
&amp; =  &amp; .030416\ldots  \approx .0304 \\
&amp; = &amp; .0304 \times 100\% = 3.04\% \text{ APR}
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				All this thinking about savings reminds Hector that he wants to own his own place someday. He promised himself that he would start putting away some money each month to save for a down payment on a condo, or maybe even a house. Sharing an apartment with three friends, postponing buying his first car, and bringing lunch from home most days leaves Hector nearly $ per month to save. His bank offers a special savings account paying 4.5% compounded monthly if he commits to making a deposit every month for at least two years.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose Hector deposits $ to the account at the end of every month. Two things happen at the end of each month – first, the interest is added to the account and, second, Hector puts another $ into the account. Let’s do a couple quick examples. At the end of the first month he just has the $. What is his balance at the end of the second month? From the <alert>Compound Interest Formula</alert> (with <m>p=\$\text{1,000}</m>, <m>r=4.5\% = 4.5 \div 100 = .045</m>, and <m>12y=1</m>) he has $ to which he adds another $ for a grand total of <me>\$\text{1,003.75}+  \$\text{1,000}= \$\text{2,003.75}</me> At the end of the third month from the <alert>Compound Interest Formula</alert> (now with <m>p=\$\text{2,003.75}</m> but still <m>r=.045</m> and <m>12y=1</m>) he has $ to which he adds another $ for a grand total of <me>\$\text{2,011.26} + \$\text{1,000} = \$\text{3,011.26}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				It would take too long to keep calculating one month at a time. Any sequence of regular deposits is an <term>annuity</term>. Luckily there’s a formula for the (future) value of an annuity.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that <m>p</m> now represents the regular, monthly deposit instead of the initial deposit. In either case think: <m>p</m> stands for <q>put in.</q> In Hector’s situation, we have <m>p=\$\text{1,000}</m> and <m>r=4.5\% =4.5 \div 100 =.045</m>. To check his balance after 3 months, we need to convert to years. Here goes. <me>3 \text{ \cancel{months} }  \frac{1 \text{ year}}{12 \text{ \cancel{months}}} =3 \div 12= .25 \text{ years}</me> so <m>y = .25</m>. From the <alert>Future Value Annuity Formula</alert>, his balance is <me>\begin{aligned}
a &amp; = &amp;  p \ast \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{r}{12}\right) ^{12y}-1}{\frac{r}{12}}\\
&amp; = &amp;    \text{1,000} \ast \frac{\left( 1 + \frac{.045}{12}\right) ^{12\ast.25}-1}{\frac{.045}{12}}\\
&amp; =  &amp;  \text{1,000} \times (( 1 + .045 \div 12) \wedge (12 \times .25)-1) \div (.045 \div 12)\\
&amp; =  &amp; \text{3,011.2640625}\ldots  \approx \$\text{3,011.26}
\end{aligned}</me> as we expected.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice how we need parentheses not only where they appear in the formula, but also around the entire numerator (top) of the fraction, around the entire denominator (bottom) of the fraction, and around the exponent. That’s going to take some practice to get used to. Especially since there are actually two open parentheses in a row.
			</p>

			<p>
				And how much will Hector have if he continues to save for a full 2 years? Use the <alert>Future Value Annuity Formula</alert> (now with <m>y=2</m>) to get the answer of $. Wow. He’ll be buying his own house in no time. By the way, if he just stuck that $ in a shoebox under his bed (meaning earning no interest) he’d have <me>\frac{\$\text{1,000}}{\cancel{\text{month}}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ \cancel{months}}}{\text{ \cancel{years}}} \ast 2 \text{ \cancel{years}}= \text{1,000} \times 12 \times 2 = \$\text{24,000}</me> The $ in his account represents a total of $ in interest. The bank is better than the shoebox.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh, but wait, there’s those looming student loans. Hector currently owes $ at 5.75% interest compounded monthly. He’s ready to start paying some of that loan off every month, which means this loan repayment is another example of an annuity. Again, two things happen at the end of each month – first, the interest is added to the account and, second, the payment is subtracted. Instead of trying examples by hand, let’s fast forward to the formula. The formula that gives the (monthly) payment for a loan (or any annuity) is
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice that <m>p</m> now represents the regular, monthly payment and <m>a</m> is the loan amount. In Hector’s situation <m>a = \$\text{16,700}</m> and <m>r=5.75\%=5.75 \div 100=.0575</m>. he would like to pay off the student loan in the next two years before he buys that house, so <m>y=2</m> years. The monthly payment from the <alert>Loan Payment Formula</alert> would be <me>\begin{aligned}
p &amp; = &amp;   \frac{a  \ast \frac{r}{12}}{1-\left( 1 + \frac{r}{12}\right) ^{-12y}} \\
&amp; = &amp;    \frac{\text{16,700} \ast \frac{.0575}{12}}{1-\left( 1 + \frac{.0575}{12}\right) ^{-12\ast 2}}\\
&amp; =  &amp; \left(\text{16,700} \times .0575 \div 12 \right) \div \left(1-(1+.0575 \div 12) \wedge (\text{(-)}12 \times 2)\right) \\
&amp; =  &amp; 738.2743896\ldots  \approx \$738.28
\end{aligned}</me> Oh boy. If Hector has to pay $738.28 per month for his student loan, that’s really going to cut into how much he can save for that down payment on a condo. (And forget about a house.) Know why we round up? Banks always do, and then the very last payment is a tiny bit less to make up for all that round up.
			</p>

			<p>
				This calculation is our most complicated so far. See the negative in the exponent? Look closely at where we added parentheses – top of fraction, bottom of fraction, exponent. Same as before. It’s going to take practice but once you get the hang of it, it is the same steps. One suggestion: write down what you plan to enter into your calculator. That helps you get it correct and, in case you mess up, someone else can at least see what your plan was.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to poor Hector. Luckily the student loan is not due in 2 years. He’s allowed 10 years to pay it back. Let’s recalculate his monthly payment assuming he takes the full 10 years instead. From the <alert>Loan Payment Formula</alert> (now with <m>y=10</m> instead), we find his new monthly payment would be $183.32. (Check!) Much more realistic. That means he would have <me>\text{1,000} - \$183.32 = \$816.68</me> to save each month towards that condo. Two years probably isn’t going to be enough time, so suppose he saves for three years instead. Notice that now we’re saving money so we went back to the <alert>Future Value Annuity Formula</alert> with the regular deposit of <m>p=\$816.58</m>, monthly interest rate of <m>4.5\% = 4.5 \div 100 = .045</m>, and <m>y=3</m> years. Go for it. Did you get <m>\approx \$\text{31,410}</m>? Good. And, great news for Hector.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are four different formulas in this section. Each has a different purpose. The exercises say which formula to use, but in subsequent courses you would have to choose for yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				A short disclaimer is in order. These formulas only work if the interest is compounded <em>monthly</em>. Can you guess how to change the formulas if the interest is paid at some other interval? Just trade out the 12s for monthly and use how ever many times per year the interest is paid instead, usually called <m>n</m> in other textbooks.

		<title>Solving equations</title>

		<p>
			One of the great powers of symbolic algebra is being able to solve equations exactly. Quick, accurate, and easily generalized, symbolic techniques have long been the backbone of algebra. The good news is that linear equations, power equations, exponential equations, and quadratic equations can all be solved exactly. That means we can find the answer to all of our problems. What more could you want? Okay, slight exaggeration there, but our ability to solve equations is worthy of some enthusiasm.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each type of equation has its own method, and so this chapter takes on each type of equation in turn. In each case, we need special operations that <q>undo</q> what’s in our equation. For example, you probably know that subtraction (<m>-</m>) undoes addition (<m>+</m>) and division <m>(\div)</m> undoes multiplication (<m>\times</m>). And both vice versa. That’s all we need to know to solve linear equations and inequalities. Do you know what undoes powers (<m>\wedge n</m>) or exponentials <m>(g\wedge</m>)? Turns out it’s roots () or logarithms (<m>\log</m>). We discuss those in more detail along the way.
		</p>

		<p>
			Everything we learned about tables, graphs, and approximating solutions is still important. Even if we solve an equation exactly, we still want to know that the answer makes sense. That’s the one thing an equation cannot do. We continue to rely on words, numbers, and graphs for that. You will likely find it a good habit to use those tools to estimate the answer before solving an equation as well doing the <q>reality check</q> after.
		</p>

		<p>
			Okay, I have to mention something here. That list of types of equations we know how to solve. That’s the good news. The bad news? Many other types of equations, including polynomials in general, do not have a sure way to solve them. So what do we do in practice? Well, for starters, successive approximation works for any type of equation. Not always quickly or easily, but if there’s a solution (and the function is nice enough), we can find it. Happily there are much fancier numeric method to approximate solutions of equations, especially using a computer.
		</p>

		<p>
			But for now, let’s solve what we can.
		</p>

				Your kitchen sink keeps getting clogged. Very annoying. Last time the plumber was able to fix it pretty quickly. But now the sink is clogged again. This time when the plumber comes and unclogs the sink, he suggests redoing the trap and a few other things that were causing the problem. You are pretty tired of it clogging up and tell him to <q>go ahead.</q> While you’re glad that the sink works when he’s done, you’re a bit shocked when his bill arrives a few days later for parts plus $278.75 in labor. Does that seem right?
			</p>

			<p>
				Remember our plumber charged $100 for just showing up and then $75 per hour for the service. Using the variables

			<p>
				we found that the equation was <me>P=100+75T</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s figure out how many hours of work would add up to a bill of $278.75. Our first approach might be to look at a table. From earlier we had
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">

			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Since $278.75 is between $250.00 and $325.00, we see that the time must be between 2 and 3 hours. You remember the plumber being there over 2 hours, so this is certainly a reasonable answer. Well, a lot of money, but mathematically it makes sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still curious, you’d like to know exactly how many hours and minutes he worked. We could use successive approximations. For example, for 2.5 hours the bill would have been <me>P=100 + 75 \ast 2.5 = 100+75\times \underline{2.5}=\$287.50</me> which is more than the charge. Continuing to guess and check we get

				The plumber worked approximately 2.38 hours. Converting units we calculate <me>.38 \text{ \cancel{hours}} \ast  \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ \cancel{hour}}} = .38 \times 60 = 22.8 \approx 23 \text{ minutes}</me> The plumber took about 2 hours, 23 minutes. Thinking back, the plumber had arrived around 10:30 in the morning and stayed past lunch, probably until around 1:00 p.m. That’s about right.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute! We could have figured this out much more quickly. If the labor cost was $278.75, we know the first $100 was the trip charge. That leaves <me>\$278.75-\$100.00 = \$178.75</me> in hourly charges. At $75 per hour that comes to <me>\$178.75\ast  \frac{\text{1 hour}}{\$75}=178.75 \div 75 = 2.3883333\ldots \approx 2.388 \text{ hours}</me> which comes to around 2 hours, 23 minutes as before. See how we used the $75/hour as a unit conversion here? Very clever.
			</p>

			<p>
				That worked well. But, can we figure out this sort of calculation in other problems? What is the general method we’re using? Can we write down our method in an organized fashion so that someone else could follow our thinking here? Turns out there is a formal way to show this calculation, called <term>(symbolically) solving</term> the equation. Officially <em>any</em> method of getting a solution to an equation is considered solving the equation, but in the rest of this book, and in most places that use algebra, when we refer to <q>solving the equation</q> or give the instruction to <term>solve</term>, we mean <em>symbolically</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s how it works. We want to figure out when <m>P=278.75</m>. We know from our equation that <m>P = 100 + 75T</m>. So we want to find the time <m>T</m> where <me>100 + 75T=278.75</me> Remember that the equal sign indicates that the two sides are the same number. On the left-hand side we have <m>100 + 75T</m>. On the right-hand side we have <m>278.75</m>. Looks different, but same thing. We are looking for the value of <m>T</m> that makes these two sides equal.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first thing we did was subtract the $100 trip charge. In this formal method, we subtract 100 from each side of our equation. If the left-hand side and the right-hand side are the same number, then they will still be equal when we take away 100 from each side. We get <me>\begin{aligned}
\cancel{100} +75T &amp; = &amp; 278.75\\
-\cancel{100}\hspace{.4in}~&amp; &amp;  -100 \\  %HSPACE
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifies to <me>75T=278.75-100=178.75</me> because the <m>+100</m> and <m>-100</m> cancelled.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next thing we did to figure out the answer was divide by the $75/hour charge. In this formal method, we can divide each side of our equation by 75. Again, if the left-hand side and right-hand side are the same number, then they will still be equal when we divide by 75. Here goes. <me>\frac{\cancel{75}T}{\cancel{75}}=\frac{178.75}{75}</me> Notice that we wrote the division in fraction form (instead of using <m>\div</m>). To understand why the 75’s cancelled, remember that <m>75T</m> is short for <m>75\ast T</m> and so <me>\frac{75T}{75} = \frac{75\ast T}{75} = 75 \times T \div 75=T</me> because the <m>\times 75</m> and <m>\div 75</m> cancelled. So we have <me>T = \frac{178.75}{75} = 178.75 \div 75 = 2.3883333\ldots</me> as before. Yet again, our answer is around 2 hours, 23 minutes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s practice working with this symbolic way of solving equations. Suppose instead the plumber went to my neighbor’s house and billed her for $160 in labor costs. How long did the plumber work at my neighbor’s? As before, we begin with our equation <me>P = 100 + 75T</me> and we are looking for <m>P=160</m>. Put these together to get <me>100+75T =160</me> Subtract 100 from each side to get <me>\begin{aligned}
\cancel{100} +75T &amp; = &amp; 160\\
-\cancel{100}\hspace{.4in}~&amp; &amp;  -100 \\  %HSPACE
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifes to <me>75T=160-100=60</me> Last, divide each side by 75 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{75}T}{\cancel{75}}=\frac{60}{75}</me> which simplifies to <me>T = \frac{60}{75} = 60\div75=.8 \text{ hours}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We have solved the equation, but it would make more sense to report our answer in minutes so we convert <me>.8 \text{ \cancel{hours}} \ast \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ \cancel{hour}}} = .8 \times 60 = 48 \text{ minutes}</me> The plumber worked for 48 minutes at my neighbor’s house.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s quick check. Since <m>T</m> is measured in hours we need to go back and use <m>T= .8</m> hours, not 48 which is in minutes. Evaluating in our original equation we get <me>P=100 + 75 \ast .8 = 100+75\times\underline{.8}= 160 \quad \checkmark</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				You might be wondering how we knew to subtract the 100 first and then later divide by 75. In this particular situation we had figured it out already and knew it made sense to take the $100 right off the top. But, in general, how would we know?
			</p>

			<p>
				It turns out that when solving an equation we do the <em>opposite</em> operations in the <em>reverse</em> order from the usual order of operations for evaluating. To evaluate a linear equation we would first multiply and then add. To solve a linear equation we first subtract (that is the opposite of adding) and then we divide (that is the opposite of multiplying).

				In the United States temperatures for everyday things like the weather or cooking are given in Fahrenheit, denoted <m>^\circ</m>F. In this system, water freezes into ice at <m>32^\circ</m>F and boils into steam at <m>212^\circ</m>F. A common setting for room temperature is <m>68^\circ</m>F whereas average human body temperature is around <m>98.6^\circ</m>F. And, most importantly, chocolate brownies bake at <m>350^\circ</m>F.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the sciences, medicine, and most other countries, temperatures are measured in Celsius, denoted <m>^\circ</m>C. (For those of us who grew up in the 1960s or earlier, <q>Celsius</q> is the temperature scale formerly known as <q>centigrade.</q>) For comparison’s sake, it’s useful to know that water freezes at <m>0^\circ</m>C and boils at <m>100^\circ</m>C. Not coincidentally – it was set up that way. Room temperature is <m>20^\circ</m>C whereas now average human body temperature is <m>37^\circ</m>C. And those brownies?
			</p>

			<p>
				A common conversion is given by the equation <me>F = 1.8C+32</me> where
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>F=</m> Fahrenheit temperature (<m>^\circ</m>F) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>C=</m> Celsius temperature (<m>^\circ</m>C) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				You may have seen this equation before with fractions in it: <m>F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32</m>. Just another way to write the equation, since <m>\frac{9}{5} = 9 \div 5 = 1.8</m>. For example, when <m>C=100</m> we have <me>F= 1.8 \ast 100 + 32 =1.8 \times \underline{100}+32= 212 \quad \checkmark</me> You can (and should check) the other examples in our story.
			</p>

			<p>
				What about those chocolate brownies? We are looking for <m>F=350</m>. That’s the dependent variable, so you can practice your linear equation solving skills to find the independent variable, <m>C</m>. It turns out that chocolate brownies bake at around <m>177^\circ C</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				But, actually, chocolate brownies just need to bake in a <term>moderate oven</term>, which means between <m>325^\circ F</m> and <m>375^\circ F</m>. Let’s first figure out when the oven temperature is under <m>375^\circ F</m>. We want to know when <me>F \le 375</me> so we have an inequality instead of an equation. Remember <m>\le</m> stands for <term>less than or equal to</term>. Using <m>F=1.8C+32</m> we get <me>1.8C+32 \le 375</me> We’re looking for values of <m>C</m> that make the left-hand side a number that’s smaller than, or maybe as large as, 375, but no larger. Quick vocabulary: equations have equal signs (=). When we have inequality signs (<m>\le</m>, <m>\ge</m>, <m>&gt;</m>, or <m>&lt;</m>), it’s called an <term>inequality</term> instead.
			</p>

			<p>
				To solve this inequality we begin the same way as we would if we were solving the equation, by subtracting 32 from each side to get <me>\begin{aligned}
1.8C + \cancel{32}&amp; \le &amp;375  \\
-\cancel{32}&amp; &amp; -32  \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifes to <me>1.8C\le375-32=343</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand why the inequality stays the same when we subtract, think of the inequality as <q>little</q> <m>\le</m> <q>big.</q> If one number is smaller than the other, the same will be true if we subtract the same amount from each number. For example, <m>18 \le 21</m>. To make it real, suppose I have $18 and you have $21. Then imagine we each buy a movie ticket for $12. I would have <m>\$18-\$12 = \$6</m> and you would have <m>\$21-\$12 = \$9</m>. And still <m>6 \le 9</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our example. We had <m>1.8C\le343</m>. Divide each side by 1.8 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{1.8}C}{\cancel{1.8} }\le \frac{293}{1.8}</me> which simplifies to <me>C\le \frac{293}{1.8}= 293 \div 1.8 = 190.555555\ldots \approx 190^\circ C</me> The oven should be set at most <m>190^\circ C</m>. We rounded down because we do not want the brownies to burn.
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand why the inequality stays the same when we divide, again think of the inequality as <q>little</q> <m>\le</m> <q>big.</q> If one number is littler than the other, the same will be true when we divide each number by the same divisor. For example, <m>6 \le 9</m>, which we imagined as my having $6 and your having $9 after we each bought a movie ticket. While we’re making up stories, suppose we each have three children who want some money from us for treats. We each divide our remaining cash among our three children, respectively. My kids each get <m>\$6\div3 =\$2</m> and your kids each get <m>\$9\div 3 = \$3</m>. And <m>2 \le 3</m> still.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a bit of caution when solving inequalities. When symbolically solving an equation, any operation you do to each side preserves the equality: start with equal amounts, do the same thing to each, end with equal amounts. But, when symbolically solving an inequality, only some operations you do to each side preserves the inequality: add or subtract from each side or multiply or divide each side by the same (positive) number. But other operations can reverse the inequality.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, we can swap sides of an equation, but if we swap sides of an inequality then the direction of the sign reverses. In this brownie example, we want <me>F \ge 325</me> Remember <m>\ge</m> stands for <term>greater than or equal to</term>. That’s like <q>big</q> <m>\ge</m> <q>little.</q> We can rewrite that inequality as <q>little</q> <m>\le</m> `̀big,” or equivalently <me>325 \le F</me> In each case, <m>325</m> is <q>little</q> and <m>F</m> is <q>big</q>. Make sense?
			</p>

			<p>
				Multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by a negative number switches the inequality sign as well. Watch out for that with decreasing functions because that’s where the slope is negative. And the number we’re dividing by is actually the slope.
			</p>

			<p>
				Remember that the recipe for chocolate brownies says to bake in a moderate oven, between <m>325^\circ F</m> and <m>375^\circ F</m>. We just figured out that <m>F \le 375</m> corresponds to <m>C \le 190</m>. But that’s only half of the story. We also wanted <m>F \ge 325</m>. While we could solve that inequality separately, it turns out there’s an easier way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Inequalities are a very useful notation for indicating <q>between</q>. We want between <m>325^\circ F</m> and <m>375^\circ F</m> to bake the brownies. We can write <me>325 \le F \le 375</me> which is read
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<q><m>F</m> is between 325 and 375 (inclusive)</q>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				The word <term>inclusive</term> indicates that we’re allowing <m>F=325</m> or <m>F=375</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The good news is that we can solve this chain of inequalities all at once using the same steps as before but now being sure to do the same thing to all <em>three</em> sides. <q><em>Three</em> sides?</q> you ask. Yes, <q>three,</q> I confirm. Watch how this works. Start with<me>325 \le F \le 375</me> Using <m>F=1.8C + 32</m> we get <me>325 \le 1.8C + 32 \le 375</me> Subtract 32 from each of the three sides to get

Oven actually aren’t that precise, so somewhere between <m>170^\circ C</m> and <m>190^\circ C</m> should do the job.

			<p>
				If we graph our linear function <m>F = 1.8C+32</m>, we can check our answer for the right temperature range for our brownies.

You can see from the highlighted region that our answer is reasonable. Now, who wants brownies?

			<title>Solving power equations (and roots)</title>

			<p>
				There’s an old saying – <q>when life gives you lemons, make lemonade.</q> But how many lemons do you need? It turns out a reasonable equation describing the juice from a single lemon is given by <me>J = .0056C^3</me> where
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>J=</m> juice (tablespoons) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>C=</m> circumference (inches) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				In case you’ve forgotten, the <term>circumference</term> is the distance <em>around</em> the lemon. Think of taking wrapping a piece of string around the middle part of the lemon. Then stretch it out on a ruler to see how long it is.
			</p>

			<p>
				Recipes for lemonade vary widely, but for my recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of lemon juice for each 12 ounce glass. The rest is a syrup made of hot water and sugar, mulled with a sweet herb like basil or mint, then finished with ice and cold water. Yum.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, how large a lemon would yield 4 tablespoons of juice? Let’s try to guess the answer. For example, a small lemon 7 inches in circumference would yield <me>J = .0056 \ast 7^3 = .0056 \times \underline{7} \wedge 3 = 1.9208 \approx 2 \text{ tablespoons}</me> A medium size lemon 8 inches in circumference would yield <me>J = .0056 \ast 8^3 = .0056 \times \underline{8} \wedge 3 = 2.8672 \approx 3 \text{ tablespoons}</me> Bet 9 inches is a good next guess. We get <me>J = .0056 \ast 9^3 = .0056 \times \underline{9} \wedge 3 = 4.0824 \approx 4  \text{ tablespoons}</me> That was quick! A lemon 9 inches around should produce just over 4 tablespoons of juice.
			</p>

			<p>
				Much as we have learned to love successive approximation, this chapter is all about solving equations. Remember, <me>J = .0056C^3</me> is a power equation because it fits the template <me>\text{dep} = k \ast \text{indep}^{n}</me> with power <m>n=3</m> and proportionality constant <m>k=.0056</m>. Turns out we can solve any power equation symbolically.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s how. We’re looking for <m>J = 4</m>. Use our equation <m>J=.0056C^3</m> to get <me>.0056C^3=4</me> We want to find the value of <m>C</m>, so we can divide both sides by .0056 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{.0056}C^3}{\cancel{.0056}}=\frac{4}{.0056}</me> which simplifies to <me>C^3 = \frac{4}{.0056}= 4 \div .0056 = 714.2857\ldots</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We have found <m>C^3</m>. How can we <q>undo</q> the <m>\wedge 3</m> to find <m>C</m>? The answer: take the cube root of each side. (More about roots at the end of this section.) That means <me>\sqrt[3]{C^3} = \sqrt[3]{714.2857\ldots}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifies to <me>C = \sqrt[3]{714.2857\ldots} =3 \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 714.2857
 = 8.9390\ldots \approx 8.9 \text{ inches}</me> as expected, just under 9 inches. (More about the <m>\sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}</m> key later too.)
			</p>

			<p>
				A look at the graph confirms our result.

				We need a large lemon, somewhere between 9.1 and 9.2 inches around. Truth is, I’ll just buy the biggest lemon I can find because extra lemon zest looks wonderful on top of the cheesecake.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are supposed to be practicing solving the equation. Here goes. We want <m>Z=1.5</m>. Use our equation <m>Z=.018C^2</m> to get <me>.018C^2=1.5</me> We want to find the value of <m>C</m>, so we can divide both sides by .018 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{.018}C^2}{\cancel{.018}}=\frac{1.5}{.018}</me> which simplifies to <me>C^2 = \frac{1.5}{.018}= 1.5 \div .018 = 83.333333\ldots</me> Take the square root of each side to get <me>\sqrt{C^2} = \sqrt{83.333333\ldots}</me> which simplifies to <me>C = \sqrt{83.333333\ldots} =\sqrt{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 83.333333
 = 9.128709292\ldots \approx 9.13 \text{ inches}</me> as expected, between 9.1 and 9.2 inches.
			</p>

			<p>
				As when solving linear equations, notice that we do the opposite operation in reverse order from the usual order of operations. To evaluate a power equation we would first raise to the power and then multiply. To solve a power equation we first divide (that is the opposite of multiplying) and then we take a root (that is the opposite of raising to a power).
			</p>

			<p>
				As promised, a brief discussion of roots is in order. Here’s the deal. Roots essential <q>undo</q> powers. What this means is, for example, we know <me>10^2=10 \times 10 =100</me> but it’s quicker to calculate it using powers as <me>10^2 = 10 \wedge 2 = 100</me> We say 10 <term>squared</term> is 100. The <term>square root</term> of a number is just whatever number you would square to get that number. So, for example, <m>\sqrt{100} = 10</m> because you would square 10 to get 100. Many calculators have a special square root key that looks like <m>\sqrt{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}</m> so we get <me>\sqrt{100} = \sqrt{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 100 = 10</me> Your calculator might insert a parenthesis with the square root, in which case you should (but don’t need to) close it before hitting <m>=</m>, like this <me>\sqrt{100} = \sqrt{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} ( 100 ) = 10</me> Your calculator might not have this key, or might need the square root after the number. Ask a classmate or your instructor or search online if you can’t figure it out.
			</p>

			<p>
				The same idea works for higher powers. Like <me>10^3 =10 \times 10 \times 10 = \text{1,000}</me> That’s really <me>10^3 = 10 \wedge 3 = \text{1,000}</me> and we say 10 <term>cubed</term> is . The <term>cube root</term> of a number is whatever number you would cube to get that number. So, for example, <m>\sqrt[3]{\text{1,000}} = 10</m>. Many calculators have a special root key that looks like <m>\sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}</m>. That <m>x</m> looks similar to multiplication (<m>\times</m>), but it isn’t. The <m>x</m> is like a placeholder for the real root you want – for a cube root <m>x</m> is just 3.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s how to use that root key. First you type in the root you want (3), second you use that key (<m>\sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}</m>), and last you type in the number you’re taking the root of () like this <me>\sqrt[3]{\text{1,000}} = 3\sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}\text{1,000}= 10</me> Like with squareroots, your calculator might introduce a parenthesis, or you might do a slightly different order. You might have to use a shift or second key to get to the root key. On many graphing calculators the <m>\sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}</m> key is one of the MATH functions, so you have to type something like MATH 5 to get it. Again, ask if you need help figuring it out.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a small chance that your calculator doesn’t have roots. In that case there is a strange-looking alternative <me>\sqrt[3]{\text{1,000}} = \text{1,000} \wedge (1 \div 3)= 10</me> Note the necessary parentheses. This process works for square roots too. <me>\sqrt{100} = \text{100} \wedge (1 \div 2)= 10</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Bet you see how this idea of roots generalizes. The <term><m>n</m>th root</term> of a number is whatever number you would raise to the <m>n</m>th power to get the number. Stated in terms of equations we have

For that year, <m>Y = 2013-2007 = 6</m> and so <me>H = 2.26 \ast 1.067^6 = 2.26 \times 1.067 \wedge \underline{6} = 3.334993223 \approx \$3.33 \text{ trillion}</me> which is already over $3 trillion. What about 2011? Use <m>Y=4</m> to check that <m>H  \approx \$2.93 \text{ trillion}</m>, which is almost, but not quite there. Must be 2012 was the year. Sure enough when <m>Y=5</m> we get <m>H \approx \$3.12 \text{ trillion}</m>. That’s it. Health care costs first passed $3 trillion in 2012. Well, at least according to our equation.

				Successive approximation gives us the answer fairly quickly. But there is an even quicker way – solving the exponential equation. Start with what we’re looking for, which is <m>H= 3</m>. Use the equation <m>H=2.26\ast1.067^Y</m> to get <me>2.26\ast1.067^Y=3</me> We want to find the value of <m>Y</m>, so divide each side by 2.26 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{2.26}\ast1.067^Y}{\cancel{2.26}}= \frac{3} {2.26}</me> which simplifies to <me>1.067^Y=\frac{3}{2.26}=3 \div 2.26 = 1.327433628\ldots</me> When the dust settles we’re left with <me>1.067^Y = 1.327433628\ldots</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Hmm. How do we find <m>Y</m> here? We saw how to use roots to solve power equations. In our lemonade example we had <m>C^3 = 714.2857\ldots</m>. We knew the exponent (3) and wanted to find the number being raised to that power (<m>C</m>). That’s when we took the cube root to get <me>C = \sqrt[3]{714.2857\ldots} =3 \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 714.2857 = 8.9390\ldots \approx 8.9 \text{ inches}</me> That approach is not going to work here because it’s backwards now – we know the number being raised to a power (1.067) and are on the hunt for the exponent (<m>Y</m>) instead.
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out there’s a different formula for solving for the exponent that uses <term>logarithms</term> (nickname: <term>logs</term>). More about logs in a minute, but first let’s write down the formula and practice working with it. The formula is
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick aside about the name. Some formulas have well-known names. Not this one. We call it the <q>Log-Divides Formula</q> because it has logs and divides in it. Perhaps you already guessed that. Other math books do not have an name for this formula, although it is related to something called the <q>change of base formula</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Okay. Back to solving our equation. We got stuck trying to solve <me>1.067^Y = 1.327433628\ldots</me> We have growth factor <m>g = 1.067</m> and value <m>v=1.327433628\ldots</m>. So the formula says <me>\begin{aligned}
Y &amp; = &amp;  \frac{\log (v)}{\log(g)}\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{\log (1.327433628\ldots)}{\log(1.067)}\\
&amp; =  &amp;  \log (1.327433628\ldots) \div \log (1.067) = \\
&amp; =  &amp;  4.367667365 \approx  4.37 
\end{aligned}</me> Your calculator should have a key that says <q>log</q> or maybe <q>LOG</q>. Try typing <me>\log( 1.327433628) \div \log (1.067) = 4.367667365 \approx 4.37</me> A small note here about parentheses. Some calculators give the first parenthesis for free when you type log but you have to type the closing parenthesis in yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				This answer of 4.37 means that costs are projected to exceed $3 trillion just over 4 years after 2007. That’s some time during 2011, or by 2012 for sure. Same answer as before.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s practice. Suppose instead we want to know when health care costs would exceed $10 trillion instead. (By the way – wow!) That means <m>H = 10</m>. Using our equation <m>H=2.26\ast1.067^Y</m> we get <me>2.26\ast1.067^Y=10</me> Before we can use the Log-Divides Formula, we need to get rid of that 2.26. To do so, we can divide both sides by 2.26 <me>\frac{\cancel{2.26}\ast1.067^Y}{\cancel{2.26}}=\frac{10}{2.26}=10 \div 2.26 = 4.424778761\ldots</me> That means <me>1.067^Y=4.424778761\ldots</me> Now our equation fits the format <m>g^Y=v</m> for the <alert>Log Divides Formula</alert> with new value <m>v=4.424778761\ldots</m> (and the growth factor is <m>g=1.067</m> still). So the answer is
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\begin{aligned}
Y &amp; = &amp;  \frac{\log (v)}{\log(g)}\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac{\log (4.424778761\ldots)}{\log(1.067)}\\
&amp; =  &amp;  \log (4.424778761\ldots) \div \log (1.067) = \\
&amp; =  &amp;  22.932891 \approx 23 
\end{aligned}</me> Want to avoid typing in the number 4.424778761…? Depending on your calculator, you might try this instead: <me>10 \div 2.26 = \log(\text{ANS}) \div \log(1.067)= 22.932891</me> where <term>ANS</term> stands for <q>answer</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Again that means 23 years after 2007, or 2007 + 23 = 2030. Health care costs are projected to exceed $10 million in the year 2030. Well, unless we do something about that. (Helps explain why government folks are often discussing how to contain health care costs.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Time to fill you in a bit more about logs. Look at these examples. Don’t take my word for it; calculate them yourself. <me>\begin{aligned}
\log (10) &amp; = &amp; 1 \\
\log (100) &amp; = &amp; 2 \\
\log (\text{1,000}) &amp; = &amp; 3 \\
\log (\text{10,000}) &amp; = &amp; 4 \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What do you see? In each case the logarithm is the number of zeros. For example, has 4 zeros and <m>\log \text{10,000}=4</m>. Another way to think of this connection is <me>\text{10,000} = 10^4 \text{ and } \log \text{10,000}=4</me> In other words, the logarithm is picking off the power of 10.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute. The Log-Divides formula helped us find the value of <m>Y</m> which was an exponent. And now we see that the log of a power of 10 is that exponent. So a logarithm is just an exponent. And logarithms help us find the exponent. Makes sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				What about logs of numbers that aren’t just powers of 10? Here are some examples. <me>\begin{aligned}
\log (25) &amp; = &amp; 1.3979\ldots \\
\log (250) &amp; = &amp; 2.3979\ldots \\
\log (\text{2,500}) &amp; = &amp; 3.3979\ldots \\
\log (\text{25,000}) &amp; = &amp; 4.3979\ldots \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To see what’s happening we want to involve powers of 10. Scientific notation will do that for us. Let’s write these numbers in scientific notation and see what we learn. For example. <me>\text{25,000} = 2.5 \times 10^4 \text{ and } \log( \text{25,000})=4.3979\ldots \approx 4</me> We are back to the power of 10. Well, approximately. Let’s check another number.

				Claude likes to juggle. As he throws a beanbag up in the air, the height changes over time as described by the equation <me>H = 3+15T-16T^2</me> where

			<p>
				Let’s make a table and graph this function. For example, when <m>T=0</m> seconds we have <me>H = 3 + 15 \ast 0-16 \ast 0^2 = 3 + 15 \times \underline{0} - 16 \times \underline{0} \wedge 2 =  3 \text{ feet}</me> and when <m>T=1</m> second we have <me>H = 3 + 15  \ast 1-16 \ast 1^2 = 3 + 15 \times \underline{1} - 16 \times \underline{1} \wedge 2 =  2 \text{ feet}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Huh? I though the beanbag went up in the air. What’s happening here? Oh, I know. The beanbag must be falling down by then. As we fill in the table with intermediate values we see how Claude’s beanbag went up in the air and then back down.

				Notice by <m>T=1.2</m> seconds we got <m>-2.04</m> feet. We can’t have negative feet. The beanbag must hit the ground before 1.2 seconds. From the graph I’d say in just over 1.1 seconds.

			<p>
				Of course, we can refine our answer by successive approximations. The beanbag hits the ground when it’s height is 0 feet. Looks a little strange but we want <m>H =0</m>. We expect the answer is just a little bigger than 1.1, so we start our guess optimistically with 1.11.

				The beanbag was in the air for approximately 1.106 seconds.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter we’ve seen how to solve linear, power, and exponential equations. Let’s solve this equation too. By the way, our function is quadratic because <me>H = 3+15T-16T^2</me> fits the template for a quadratic equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				with constants <me>a = -16 \quad b = 15 \quad c = 3</me> (More on how we found those numbers in a moment.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to our juggler. We are trying to figure out when <m>H=0</m>. Using our equation <m>H=3+15T-16T^2</m>, we get <me>3+15T-16T^2=0</me> We want to solve for <m>T</m>. Notice that because <m>T</m> occurs twice in the equation, nothing we have seen to do to each side of the equation can knock it down to just one <m>T</m>. That means none of our methods so far work. Luckily there’s a way to solve any quadratic equation using the aptly-named <alert>Quadratic Formula</alert>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh my! First thing to understand in this complicated formula is that we actually get two possible answers <me>T = \frac{-b}{2a}+ \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \quad \text{and} \quad T = \frac{-b}{2a} - \frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</me> Sometimes one answer makes sense in the story, other times they both might. Stay tuned.
			</p>

			<p>
				For Claude’s situation we had <me>3+15T-16T^2=0</me> To fit the formula, we need the <m>T^2</m> first, the <m>T</m> second, and then the constant. No sweat, just reorder to get <me>-16T^2 + 15T + 3=0</me> Notice how subtracting <m>16T^2</m> became adding <m>-16T^2</m> when we rearranged? That lines up perfectly with <me>aT^2+bT+c=0</me> That’s how we knew the constants were <me>a = -16 \quad b = 15 \quad c = 3</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				The first fraction in the formula is <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{-b}{2a} &amp; = &amp; \frac{-15}{2\ast-16} =  \text{(-)}15 \div (2 \times \text{(-)}16) = .46875
\end{aligned}</me> As usual, we needed parentheses around the denominator (bottom) of our fraction to override the normal order of operations. As a reminder, <m>\text{(-)}</m> refers to negation. Remember, this does not mean you type in parentheses, just hit the one key that is labeled already.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second fraction is <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} &amp; = &amp;   \frac{\sqrt{(15)^2-4 \ast -16 \ast 3}}{2 \ast-16}\\
&amp; = &amp;   \sqrt{~} ( (15) \wedge 2 - 4 \times  \text{(-)}16 \times 3) \div (2 \times  \text{(-)}16)\\
&amp; =  &amp; -.6381431\ldots \approx -.63814
\end{aligned}</me> Check out the parentheses now. Three sets here. First, around the quantity we’re taking the square root of. Maybe your calculator included the open parentheses along with the square root, but either way we need them. Second, around the number (15) that we are squaring. That didn’t matter here but if <m>b</m> were negative it would have. Last, we added parentheses around the bottom of the fraction, as always.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh, and we’re not done yet. Remember there are two possible answers. One is the sum of these two numbers <me>.46875 +  \text{(-)}.63814 = -.16939 \text{ seconds}</me> which doesn’t make any sense because time is never negative. The other is the difference <me>.46875 -  \text{(-)}.63814 = 1.10689 \text{ seconds}</me> We had guessed around 1.106 seconds, so that is definitely the right answer: Claude’s beanbag will hit the ground after 1.10689 seconds. Yeah, too precise. But you get the idea.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute! Any good juggler isn’t about to let the beanbag fall on the ground. He’s going to catch it again, perhaps at about 3 feet above ground. That means we’re looking for <m>H=3.5</m>. Using our equation <m>H=3+15T-16T^2</m>, we get <me>3+15T-16T^2=3.5</me> The <alert>Quadratic Formula</alert> only works if the equation has <m>=0</m>, but we have <m>=3.5</m>. It might seem that we’re out of luck, but it’s an easy fix. Just subtract 3.5 from each side. <me>\begin{aligned}
 \nonumber
3+15T-16T^2 &amp; = &amp; \cancel{3.5} \\ \nonumber
-3.5 \hspace{.9in}~ &amp; = &amp;-\cancel{3.5}\\ \nonumber %HSPACE
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifies to <me>\begin{aligned}
 \nonumber
-.5+15T -16T^2 &amp; = &amp; 0 \\ \nonumber
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				So now we have <m>=0</m>. Yes!
			</p>

			<p>
				We can write the new equation as <me>-16T^2 + 15T -.5= 0</me> from which we see that <me>a = -16 \quad b = 15</me> as before, but now we have a new value <me>c=-.5</me> We’re all set to use the <alert>Quadratic Formula</alert>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first fraction is <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{-b}{2a} &amp; = &amp;  \frac{-(15)}{2 \ast -16} =  \text{(-)}15 \div (2 \times  \text{(-)}16) = .46875
\end{aligned}</me> No surprise here. We used the same values of <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> as before, so we should have the same number here. The second fraction is <me>\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} &amp; = &amp;   \frac{\sqrt{(15)^2-4 \ast -16 \ast -.5}}{2 \ast-16}\\
&amp; = &amp;   \sqrt{~} ( (15) \wedge 2 - 4 \times  \text{(-)}16 \times  \text{(-)}.5) \div (2 \times  \text{(-)}16)\\
&amp; =  &amp; -.43413887\ldots \approx -.43414
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Don’t forget we need to put together these parts to find the possible answers. The sum gives us <me>.46875 +  \text{(-)}.43414 = .03461 \approx .03 \text{ seconds}</me> and the difference gives us <me>.46875 -  \text{(-)}.43414 = .90289 \approx .9 \text{ seconds}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Both answers seem to make sense. Let’s look at the graph to confirm that they’re reasonable. We first find <m>H=3.5</m> while the beanbag is going up in the air, just before the unlabeled gridline for .05 (midway between 0 and .1) so an answer of <m>T\approx .03</m> makes sense. Then, on the way back down, the beanbag is 3.5 feet up at what looks like .9 seconds, so our answer of <m>T \approx .9</m> makes sense too. Since Claude catches the beanbag on the way down, we want that second answer, after .90289 seconds (which is before 1.106 seconds when it hits the ground, by the way).
			</p>

			<p>
				One interesting note. What happens in the story at the point where the beanbag stops going up in the air and starts falling down? That must be when the beanbag is at its highest point. What is the speed at that highest point? Well, I guess 0. For a split second it’s almost frozen in midair, neither rising nor falling. (If we were able to compute the rate of change for an interval really, small time then we would find the rate of change <m>\approx 0</m>.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Turns out it’s easy to find that point for a quadratic equation, just plug in the first fraction from the Quadratic Formula! Check it out. When <me>T = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-15}{2 \ast -16}=  \text{(-)}15 \div (2 \times  \text{(-)} 16)= .46875 \text{ seconds}</me> we get
			</p>

			<p>
				<me>\begin{aligned}
H &amp;= &amp;3 + 15 \ast .46875-16 \ast .46875^2 \\ 
&amp; = &amp; 3 + 15 \times \underline{.46875} - 16 \times \underline{.46875} \wedge 2 \\
&amp; = &amp;  6.515625\ldots \approx 6.516 \text{ feet}
\end{aligned}</me> Claude throws the beanbag about 6.516 feet up. Converting to more normal units we get <me>.516 \text{ \cancel{feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{\text{\cancel{feet}}} = .516 \times 12 = 6.192 \approx 6 \text{ inches}</me> The beanbag goes up to about 6’6". You can check that the graph shows just over 6.5 feet.
			</p>

			<p>
				In general, the graph of <m>H = aT^2+bT+c</m> is a <term>parabola</term>. The two solutions from the <alert>Quadratic Formula</alert> are both places where <m>H=0</m> and, so, the graph crosses the <m>T</m>-axis there. Might not make sense in the real problem, but the equation and formula don’t know that. (Okay, equations and formulas don’t actually ”know” anything. But you get my point.) Turns out the graph is symmetric about the highest point, so that must be midway in between the roots which is exactly where <me>T =\frac{-b}{2a}</me> Because <m>a</m> is negative, the answer we got by adding is to the left and the answer we got by subtracting is to the right.

				Our graph was <m>\cap</m> shaped parabola and so we found a maximum value. The graph of a quadratic function might be <m>\cup</m> shaped instead. In that case evaluating at <m>T=\frac{-b}{2a}</m> would give the minimum value.

		<title>A closer look at linear equations</title>

		<p>
			And topping the algebra charts at #1 for the past two millennia and counting, it’s …linear equations. Why? First, many everyday and scientific events are naturally linear. Second, many decidedly nonlinear functions can be reasonably approximated by a linear function. Third, sometimes we don’t actually have an equation that perfectly fits our information (data) at all, so a reasonably close equation is better than none at all and linear equations often do a good job as a first approximation. Last, and perhaps most importantly, we can solve linear equations. Easily. Exactly. Every time.
		</p>

		<p>
			We have encountered linear equations often in this text already, so this chapter begins with a review section on everything we have seen: modeling with linear equations; interpreting linear equations, especially slope and intercept; graphing lines; solving linear equations and inequalities; and what it means for a function to be linear in the first place.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then we dive deeper. For example, the second section of this chapter explores situations that involve comparing or coordinating several linear equations at once in a system. After that, we take a closer look at slope and intercepts to revisit modeling with linear equations in contexts where we are not told the slope and intercept. We pause to look at when a linear function is a direct proportion. We end with a section on the idea of fitting a line to data.
		</p>

		<p>
			You might have seen most, if not all, of the ideas and techniques in this chapter. Why are we studying linears yet again, then? Because they’re #1.
		</p>

				A family with one full-time worker earning minimum wage cannot afford the local fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States. Even families earning above minimum can struggle to rent an apartment for less than 30% of their income. As a result, many people need affordable housing. There are various local, state, and federally funded programs as well as non-profit agencies working to increase availability.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="footnotesize"-->

			<p>
				In our city there are about apartments considered affordable. So the city partnered with local developers to build more apartments each year. Our variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">

				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Assuming things proceed as planned, after 5 years there would be <me>\text{64,100 apts } + 5 \text{ years} \ast \frac{\text{7,800 apts}}{\text{year}}=\text{64,100}+\underline{5} \times \text{7,800} =  \text{103,100} \text{ apartments}</me> Generalizing, we get our equation <me>\text{64,100}+Y\ast \text{7,800} =  A</me> which can be rewritten as <me>A = \text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y</me> This equation fits our template for a linear equation <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } + \text{slope} \ast {\text{indep}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick recap. A function is <term>linear</term> if its graph is a line, and <term>nonlinear</term> otherwise. The rate of change measures the steepness of the graph for any function, but a line is the same steepness everywhere, so the rate of change, or <term>slope</term> of a line is constant. Our example is linear because the slope of apartments per year is constant. Our starting or fixed amount is the <term>intercept</term>. In our example it’s apartments. The dependent variable and the intercept always have the same units – apartments in our example. But <me>\text{units for slope} =\frac{\text{units for dep}}{\text{units for indep}}</me> so, in our example slope is measured in apartments <em>per year</em>. These units can help you identify the slope and intercept in a story – so keep a look out.
			</p>

			<p>
				How many years will it take the city to reach apartments at this rate? After ten years, for example, there would still not be enough affordable apartments because <me>A = \text{64,100}+\text{7,800} \ast 10 = \text{64,100}+  \text{7,800}\times \underline{10}=  \text{142,100} \text{ apartments}</me> Continuing successive approximation we get

				This city will reach affordable apartments within 12 years.

			<p>
				Of course, we could solve a linear equation instead. We want <m>A=\text{150,000}</m>. Using our equation <m>A=\text{64,100} + \text{7,800} Y</m> we get <me>\text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y = \text{150,000}</me> However, since we want <em>at least</em> affordable apartments, an inequality is even better. Let’s practice that. <me>\text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y \ge \text{150,000}</me> Subtract from each side to get <me>\begin{aligned}
\cancel{\text{64,100}} + \text{7,800}Y &amp; \ge &amp;\text{150,000}  \\
-\cancel{\text{64,100}} \hspace{.6 in} &amp; &amp; -\text{64,100}  \\ % SU awkward to use hspace!
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifies to <me>\text{7,800}Y\ge \text{85,900}</me> Divide each side by to get <me>\frac{\cancel{\text{7,800}}~Y}{\cancel{\text{7,800}}} \ge \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}}</me> which simplifies to <me>Y \ge   \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}} = \text{85,900} \div \text{7,800} = 11.0128205...</me> To be sure <m>Y \ge 11.0128205...</m> we need to round up to get <me>Y \ge 12</me>
			</p>

				Let’s confirm our findings on the graph.

			<title>Systems of linear equations</title>

				A local factory produces small locks for industrial use. The old machine has seen better days and Quia Xun, the manager, is shopping around for a new machine. She’s narrowed it down to two options. The first option is replace the old machine with a new model (Machine #1) for $. The second is a larger unit (Machine #2) priced at $. In each case, the price includes installation and the standard service contract. The reason she is considering the more expensive machine is Machine #2 runs at a cost of only $.80 per lock, whereas the replacement Machine #1 runs at a cost of $1.25 per lock.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Machine #1 is less expensive, Quia Xun knows it is the right choice if the factory only produces a small number of locks. But since Machine #2 costs less per lock to run, she knows it will pay off if the factory makes a large number of locks. She would like to understand the total expenditure better, particularly the number of locks at which it would be worthwhile to invest in the more expensive machine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Quia Xun is interested in how the total expenditure, including both the purchase price and the running cost, depend on the number of locks produced, the variables are

			<p>
				She recognizes that total expenditure is a linear function of the purchase price and the running cost for each machine. In each case, the starting amount (intercept) is the purchase price: $ for Machine #1 and $ for Machine #2. The slope (rate of change) is the constant running cost: $.80 per lock for Machine #1 and $1.25 per lock for Machine #2. Using the template for a linear equation <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } + \text{ slope} \ast {\text{indep}}</me> she writes the equations

				Even at locks, Machine #1 is the better deal. By locks, Machine #2 becomes the better deal. Somewhere in between it switches.
			</p>

			<p>
				Quia Xun makes a quick graph to see what’s going on. On the graph, whichever line is lower corresonds to the lower total expenditure and whichever line is higher corresponds to the higher total expenditure. As suspected, for a smaller number of locks the line for Machine #1 is lower on the graph, so that’s the better deal. For a larger number of locks it switches and the line for Machine #2 is lower on the graph, since that’s the better deal instead. Where they switch corresponds to the point on the graph where the two lines cross, somewhere around locks.

			<p>
				So the choice changes somewhere between and locks.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a way for Quia Xun to solve the problem symbolically; we refer to this process as <term>solving the system</term>. She wants to find the number of locks where <me>\text{cost of Machine \#1} = \text{cost of Machine \#2}</me> Using her equations <m>E  =\text{3,200} + 1.25L</m> for Machine #1 and <m>E  =\text{5,400} + .80L</m> for Machine #2 she has <me>\text{3,200} + 1.25L=\text{5,400} + .80L</me> She wants to find the value of <m>L</m> that makes both sides the same number. To solve, Quia Xun subtracts , the smaller of the two purchase prices, from each side to get <me>\begin{aligned}
\cancel{\text{3,200}} + 1.25L &amp; = &amp; \text{5,400} + .80L \\
-\cancel{\text{3,200}} \hspace{.5 in} &amp; &amp; -\text{3,200}  \\ %HSPACE
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				which simplifies to <me>1.25L = \text{2,200} + .80L</me> Pause for a minute. What does that $ mean in the story? It’s the extra cost of buying Machine #2 because <m>\$\text{5,400} - \$\text{3,200} = \$\text{2,200}</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				What next? This equation has the variable <m>L</m> on each side. Quia Xun needs to combine them somehow. Here’s how to do that. Subtract <m>.80L</m> from each side. Look closely. She is subtracting <m>.80L</m>, not just <m>.80</m>. We get <me>\begin{aligned}
1.25L &amp; = &amp; \text{2,200} + \cancel{.80L}\\
-.80L &amp; &amp; \hspace{.4in}-\cancel{.80L}  \\ %HSPACE
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				How do we simplify <m>1.25L-.80L</m>? Think about what these numbers represent in the story. The cost was $1.25 per lock versus $.80 per lock. The difference is $1.25-$.80 = $.45 per lock. So that means <me>1.25L -.80L = .45L</me> Think: 125 apples <m>-</m> 80 apples <m>=</m> 45 apples. She can now simplify her equation to get <me>.45L = \text{2,200}</me> Ah, she can solve this equation just by dividing each side by .45 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{.45}L}{\cancel{.45}}= \frac{\text{2,200}}{.45}</me> which simplifies to <me>L = \frac{\text{2,200}}{.45}= \text{2,200} \div .45 = 4888.88888\ldots \approx \text{4,889} \text{ locks}</me> If they plan to produce 4,889 locks or more, Quia Xun should go ahead and buy the more expensive machine, Machine #2. Yeah, that’s what we guessed – just under locks is the payoff.
			</p>

			<p>
				She solved an equation here, but Quia Xun really wanted to know when <me>\text{Machine \#1} \ge \text{Machine \#2}</me> so she could have solved the inequality <me>\text{3,200} + 1.25L \ge \text{5,400} + 0.80L</me> instead. Check that the same steps give <me>L \ge 4,889 \text{ locks}</me>

										Maria needed to replace the light bulb in the hallway. When she went to the home improvement store she was overwhelmed with the choices of light bulbs.

			<title>Intercepts and direct proportionality</title>

			<p>
				Kaleb runs 8 minute miles, which means it takes him around 8.5 minutes to run each mile. Yesterday he was out for about 30 minutes and ran the 2.8 mile loop by our house. That strikes me as curious because if he ran 2.8 miles at <m>8.5</m> minutes per mile that should take <me>\frac{8.5 \text{ minutes}}{\text{mile}} \ast 2.8 \text{ miles} = 8.5 \times 2.8 = 23.8 \approx 24 \text{ minutes}</me> But Kaleb took 30 minutes. That’s 6 minutes longer than expected. Well, technically 6.2 minutes since <me>30 - 23.8 = 6.2 \approx 6 \text{ minutes}</me> but let’s work with 6 since the 30 was only approximate to begin with.
			</p>

			<p>
				The point is, what’s up with that missing 6 minutes? Oh, I bet I know what it is. Ever since Kaleb turned fifty years old, he’s been having trouble with his knees. I bet he’s finally stretching like his doctor ordered. Must be around 6 minutes of stretches after each run.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since Kaleb’s total time is function of how far he runs, our variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>T=</m> total time (minutes) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>D =</m> distance (miles) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Notice that we are determining how the time depends on the distance, so the time <m>T</m> is our dependent variable. Often time is the independent variable, but not so here.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the sake of this problem, we assume Kaleb runs a steady 8.5 minutes per mile so the rate of change is constant. The equation must be linear and so it fits the template <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } + \text{slope} \ast {\text{indep}}</me> The slope is 8.5 minutes per mile. The 6 minutes Kaleb spends stretching is the intercept, even though it’s named <q>start</q> in the template and Kaleb is actually stretching at the end of his run. A better name might be <q>fixed.</q> Whatever you call it, the equation is <me>\textbf{Kaleb:}\quad  T = 6 + 8.5D</me> As a quick check, for that 2.8 mile run we have <m>D=2.8</m> and so <me>T = 6 + 8.5 \ast 2.8 = 6 + 8.5 \times \underline{2.8} = 29.8 \approx 30 \text{ minutes}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, there’s a shorter way to find the intercept. The intercept is the <q>starting value,</q> or in this case the time spent stretching. So we take the total time and then subtract out the time spent running <me>\text{intercept }=30 - 8.5 \times 2.8 = 6.2 \approx 6 \text{ minutes}</me> In general, <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -  \text{slope} \ast \text{indep}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Kaleb’s daughter Muna runs considerably faster, 7 minute miles, and she’s not into stretching at all. For her to run the 2.8 mile loop by our house, it would take <me>\frac{7 \text{ minutes}}{\text{mile}} \ast 2.8 \text{ miles} = 7 \times 2.8 = 19.6 \text{ minutes}</me> That means while her dad would take 30 minutes to run the loop and do his stretches, Muna can run it in just under 20 minutes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The equation for Muna is <me>\textbf{Muna:}\quad  T = 7D</me> The slope is 7 minutes per mile. What’s the intercept for this equation? There’s no time for stretching in her equation, so it’s like <m>T = 0 + 7D</m>. The intercept is 0 minutes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Compare the graphs. Each intercept shows where that line meets the vertical axis. Kaleb’s crosses at 6 minutes, but Muna’s crosses at 0 minutes, at the origin (where the two axes cross).
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='runtimes.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				By the way, Muna’s equation <m>T = 7D</m> is a <term>direct proportionality</term> because the only thing happening is that the independent variable is being scaled by a <term>proportionality constant</term>, <m>k=7</m>. Any direct proportionality fits this template.
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand the proportionality, recall that Muna can run 2.8 miles in 19.6 minutes. What happens if she goes for a run twice as long? Then she would be running <m>2 \times 2.8 = 5.6</m> miles. Her time would be <me>T = 7 \ast 5.6 = 7 \times \underline{5.6} = 39.2 \text{ minutes}</me> Notice that <m>2 \times 19.6 = 39.2</m>. So, it would take her twice the time to run twice the distance. This general idea – that you get twice the value of the dependent variable if you have twice the value of the independent variable – characterizes direct proportions. We sometimes say that Muna’s time is <term>proportional</term> to how far she runs. Nothing special about twice here, as it would take her three times the time to run three times the distance, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				Not so for Kaleb. Remember it takes him 29.8 minutes to run that 2.8 miles. If he runs twice the distance, which is 5.6 miles, it takes <me>T = 6+8.5 \ast 5.6 = 6+ 8.5 \times \underline{5.6} = 53.6 \text{ minutes}</me> which is not quite twice the time, since <m>2 \times 29.8 = 59.6 \text{ minutes}</m>. The key is that Kaleb does not stretch twice, only once, for the longer run so double the distance does not count the 6 minutes again. Kaleb’s equation is not a direct proportionality. Another way to say that is that Kaleb’s time is not proportional to how far he runs. It is a function of how far he runs, yes, but not proportionally so.

				Last week our supplier delivered 13 cases of paper for the office and charged us $534.87. This week, they delivered 20 cases of paper for $814.80. We assume that their charge includes a fixed delivery fee and per case cost, so the dependence must be linear. We would like to understand their pricing scheme better by writing the equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				What to do? We can name the variables and put the information we are given into a table. That’s a start. The variables must be
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">

				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				and we know
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>N</m></cell>

				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Let’s see. The fixed delivery fee that we don’t know is the intercept. The per case cost that we also don’t know is the slope. To write the linear equation we need to know both.
			</p>

			<p>
				The slope is just the rate of change, so we can figure out the slope just from the information in our table. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$814.80-\$534.87}{20-13 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; \frac{\$279.93}{7 \text{ cases}} = 279.93 \div 7 = \$39.99 \text{ per case}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				or, all at once, as <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$814.80-\$534.87}{20-13 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; (814.80-534.87)\div(20-13)= \$39.99 \text{ per case}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Either way, each case costs $39.99 and the slope is $39.99 per case.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we know the slope, we can find the intercept. At $39.99 per case we would expect 13 cases to cost <me>13 \text{ cases } \ast \frac{\$39.99}{\text{case}} = 13 \times 39.99 = \$519.87</me> But the story tells us 13 cases cost $534.87. The difference <m>\$534.87 - \$519.87 = \$15</m> must be the delivery fee which is the intercept. Remember <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}= 534.87 - 39.99\times 13= \$15</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Why did we use 13 cases? No good reason. Look what happens if we use 20 cases at $814.80 instead. <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}= 814.80 - 39.99\times 20= \$15</me> Yup. Still $15 delivery fee.
			</p>

			<p>
				The equation is linear so it fits our template <me>\text{dep} = \text{start} + \text{slope} * \text{indep}</me> and now that we know the slope and intercept, we can put those in to get our equation. <me>C = 15 + 39.99N</me> Let’s check. When <m>N = 13</m> we get <me>C=15 + 39.99 \ast 13 = 15 + 39.99 \times \underline{13} = \$534.87 \quad \checkmark</me> and when <m>N=20</m> we get <me>C=15 + 39.99 \ast 20 = 15 + 39.99 \times \underline{20} = \$814.80 \quad \checkmark</me> You can also check that the graph goes through the original two points we were given. The intercept is $15, but because of the scale it shows up as barely above $0 on our graph.

				The supplier also picks up recyclable paper and boxes. The normally charge $18 per pickup but under a new reuse incentive program, they discount a little for each box that’s in good enough condition to use again. This week’s recycling charge was only $7.60 because we returned the previous 13 boxes all in good shape.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we’re interested in how the recycling charge depends on the number of boxes in good condition that we return. The new variables are

			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				See how we used <m>B=0</m> for the situation where no boxes are returned? Clever.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can draw the graph using just these two points. (But we’ll check later, once we have the equation, to be sure.)
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='recyclepaper.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Since there is a fixed discount per box, we again have a linear function. We know the intercept is the normal recycling fee of $18. We need to find the slope. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$7.60-\$18}{13-0 \text{ cases}} \\
&amp; = &amp; (7.60-18)\div(13-0)= -\$.80 \text{ per box}\\

				It might look funny to get a negative, but it’s to be expected. They are subtracting for each good box returned. The discount is 80 per box and so the equation is <me>R = 18 - .8B</me> Check when <m>B=13</m> we have <me>R = 18 -.8*13 = 18-.8 \times \underline{13} = \$7.60 \quad \checkmark</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				What’s the most boxes you could get credit for? Probably the most they discount is the full $18, which would mean that <m>R=0</m>. That means we want to solve <m>18 -.8B = 0</m>. Check that we get <m>B = 22.5 \text{ boxes}</m>, which means that 22 boxes would be almost $0 and for 23 boxes, they should pick up for free. We can check that 22 boxes gives <me>R = 18-.8\ast22=18-.8 \times \underline{22} = \$.40</me> and 23 boxes gives <me>R = 18-.8\ast23=18-.8 \times \underline{23} = -\$.40 \implies \text{free}</me> Well, unless they’re nice and give us cash back.

										I just saw an advertisement for the same paper we use at the office for only $4.25 per ream at a supply store. (Ream? Yes. That’s 500 sheets of paper, usually wrapped in paper.) Is that a good deal?

															I’m not sure I want to go get a case of paper myself because a case of paper is pretty heavy to lift. Paper is sold by the weight. Thick, heavier paper is considered fancier than lighter paper.

			<title>Fitting lines to data</title>

			<p>
				Thanh has an internship studying road salt usage in a northern metropolitan area. Road salt is used to melt ice and snow on paved streets. Because it can damage vegetation and influence both surface water (lakes) and ground water, and because it costs money to run the trucks that apply the salt, people are interested in the amount of road salt used.
			</p>

			<p>
				One data set compares road salt usage per county. Thanh learned from county officials that road salt use varies widely from county to county, but, not surprisingly, it depends heavily on the length of road in the county. So, the variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->

				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				A <term>lane mile</term> is the area of road one mile long and one lane wide. Now you know.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanh also learned that while road salt use is a function of lane miles, it is not proportional as there are more complicated factors involved. Still, he would like to model road salt use as a function of road length. Here are the data for counties in the metro area.
			</p>

				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				To develop his model Thanh imagined a new county, County X, that had 600 lane miles of road. In looking at the data, he finds two counties with close to 600 lane miles.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County T</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County X</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County A</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>L</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">510</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">600</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">710</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>S</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">?</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Based on this data, Thanh expects County X would use between and tons/year of road salt. Since 600 is closer to 510 than to 710, he starts with a guess of around tons/year of road salt.
			</p>

			<p>
				To improve this estimate, Thanh decides to use a linear mode, hoping that will account for both road length influence and fixed factors. He begins by finding the slope. <me>\begin{aligned}
\text{slope} &amp; = &amp; \text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\text{14,700}-\text{5,000 tons/year}}{710-510 \text{ lane miles}} \\
&amp; = &amp; (\text{14,700}-\text{5,000})\div(710-510)= 48.5 \text{ tons/year per lane mile}\\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next he calculates the intercept. <me>\text{intercept} = \text{dep} -\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}=  \text{5,000} - 48.5\times 510= -\text{19,735 tons/year}</me> He was not expecting a negative value but decides to use it anyway. Using the template for a linear equation <me>\text{dep} = \text{start} + \text{slope} * \text{indep}</me> Thanh gets <me>S = -\text{19,735} + 48.5L</me> which he rewrites as <me>S = 48.5L-\text{19,735}</me> As a check, for <m>L=710</m> lane miles, he gets <me>S=48.5 \times \underline{710}-\text{19,735}=\text{14,700 tons/year}\quad \checkmark</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				More importantly, for 600 miles his equation gives the estimate of <me>S=48.5 \times \underline{600}-\text{19,735}=\text{9,365 tons/year}</me> Thanh rounds this estimate to tons/year of road salt for County X, which is close to his initial guess of tons/year.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, Thanh imagines another new county, County Y, that has 500 lane miles of road. He looks to the data for counties with close to 500 lane miles.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County W</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County Y</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">County T</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>L</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">480</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">500</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">510</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>S</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">?</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Wait a minute. The county with fewer roads used more salt? That doesn’t make sense.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanh decides to look at all the data at once in a scatter plot.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='roadsaltSCATTER.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				When Thanh was using the nearby points to estimate for Counties X and Y, it’s as if he were connecting the dots with line segments on the graph. Notice that the line that goes through 500 lane miles is decreasing, just like Thanh saw in his table.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='roadsaltCONNECTDOTS.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Thanh suspects that this connect-the-dots model is too heavily influenced by individual county road-salting habits. He would like a way to get one line to use for everything, knowing full well that one line cannot possibly go through all of the data points.
			</p>

			<p>
				Which line to use? One option would be to stick with the line he found through the points for Counties T and A. He redraws the scatter plot to show that line. Because the intercept is negative, it doesn’t show up on his graph. The line seems to be too low at first and too high later. The problem is that this line is too steep (has too large a slope).
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				  <image source='roadsaltTAline.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Thanh decides to try a line that is less steep. After drawing in a few lines, he decides to try the line between the points for Counties C and D instead, which has equation <me>\textbf{C-D line:} \quad S = 20.26L-\text{4,610}</me> Unfortunately this line seems too low. (Again the negative intercept isn’t visible.)
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='roadsaltCDline.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Neither of these lines came close to the point for County H on the far right, so Thanh considers one more line, this time through County H and County R, which has equation <me>\textbf{H-R line:} \quad S = 8.71L+\text{3,130}</me> This line has a positive intercept just above tons/year, as you can see on the graph.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				  <image source='roadsaltHRline.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Thanh thinks the H-R line is reasonable, but it makes him wonder how to decide if one line is better than another. Generally speaking the <term>best fitting line</term> makes the space between the line and the data points as small as possible. (There is actually a much more official definition.) After using a little statistical software, Thanh determines that for this data set, the official best fitting line has equation <me>\textbf{Best fitting line:} \quad S = 10.0L+\text{2,741}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanh wants to add this line to his graph so first he calculates a few values. While it’s true that any two points would do, he played it safe and plotted three points, being sure to use 0 in order to find the intercept.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>L</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">0</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center">600</cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>S</m></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
					<cell right="minor" halign="center"></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				He graphs this line and notices it is very similar to the H-R line, just a tiny bit higher and a tiny bit steeper. The points from the table are highlighted on the graph just to help you see how we graphed the line. Remember, those aren’t actual data points.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='roadsaltbestfit.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				Thanh is bothered by the fact that County H seems to be off on its own. The largest city in this area is in County H. Between the budget crunch and the nature of the urban landscape, the city tends to use much less road salt than the surrounding areas. So County H really isn’t very typical at all. In statistics, this sort of value is known by the descriptive term <term>outlier</term> (as in <q>it lies way out there.</q>)
			</p>

			<p>
				So Thanh decides to look at the statistically best-fitting line ignoring County H this time. Back to his software and he finds <me>\textbf{Best fitting line (ignoring outlier):} \quad S = 19.7L-\text{2,905}</me> This line is less steep than the T-A line and higher than the C-D line. Seems perfect.

										Wild rice is a native plant that grows in lakes in the upper Midwest. The table shows how the annual acreage of wild rice has varied with the average spring temperature in various years. The variables are <m>T</m> for the temperature measured in <m>^{\circ}</m>F and <m>W</m> for the wild rice yield, measured in acres. In case you’re curious, the year is included as well, but it’s not one of the variables we’re interested in.

		<title>A closer look at exponential equations</title>

		<p>
			We have seen how exponential equations help us understand a variety of situations – from investments and loans, to rising health care costs, to population growth, or any quantity increasing at a fixed percentage. But that’s not all. In this chapter we explore other situations in which exponential equations help us understand any type of exponential growth (increasing) as well as exponential decay (decreasing).
		</p>

		<p>
			We have encountered exponential equations often in this text already, so this chapter begins with a review section on everything we have seen: modeling with exponential equations; interpreting exponential growth, especially the growth factor and percent increase; graphing exponential equations; solving exponential equations using logs; and the connection between percent increase and exponential growth in the first place.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, we study exponential growth in more detail, including finding the growth factor when we are not told the percent change. We also study exponential decay, including situations where we know the percentage decrease. After that we compare how linear or exponential equations model situations where it’s not clear which to use. We close with a section on comparing exponential growth to alternative models.

			<title>Modeling with exponential equations</title>

			<p>
				My grandmother was born in eastern Europe at the end of the 1800s. When she was eight years old her parents brought her and her younger sister and brother to the United States to escape harsh treatment by the government. Both her parents had to work, so my grandmother dropped out of school when she was thirteen years old to take care of the children, which now included another brother and sister.
			</p>

			<p>
				Time passed and she married a handsome young veteran of World War I, who had also immigrated to the country as a young child. For her wedding dowry his parents bought my grandmother a set of sterling silverware, valued at $800 in 1920. My grandmother was very proud of her sterling and used it often.
			</p>

			<p>
				Over the years, the sterling has increased in value, let’s say by around 3% per year. In 1957, my grandmother handed it down to my mother as a wedding present. In 1990, I married and my mother handed the sterling down to me. What was it was it worth at those times, and how much should it be insured for through 2015?
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s write the equation to answer these questions. The variables should be
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>S=</m> value of sterling ($) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>Y =</m> time (years since 1920) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				We’re saying that the sterling increased 3% per year in value. For example, in 1921, the sterling was worth <me>\$800 + 3\% \text{ of } \$800 = 800 + .03 \times 800 = 800 + 24= \$824</me> Remember the shortcut here? <me>800 \times 1.03 = 824</me> The idea is after one year we have the original $800 plus 3% more for a grand total of 103% of what we had before. And 103% = 1.03.
			</p>

			<p>
				After 5 years, the sterling was worth <me>800 \ast 1.03 \ast 1.03  \ast 1.03  \ast 1.03  \ast 1.03 = 800 \ast 1.03^5</me> since multiplying by 1.03 five times is the same as multiplying by <m>1.03^5</m>. On the calculator we do <me>800 \times 1.03 \wedge 5 = 927.4192594 \approx \$927</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Generalizing, we get our equation <me>800 \times 1.03 \wedge Y= S</me> which can be rewritten as <me>S=800 \ast 1.03 ^ Y</me> This equation fits our template for an exponential equation <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } \ast \text{growth factor}^{\text{indep}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick recap. A function is <term>exponential</term> if it corresponds to a fixed percent increase (or decrease). The percent increase is the <term>growth rate</term>; in our example, the growth rate is <m>r=3\%=.03</m>. The number we multiply by is the <term>growth factor</term> and it is also the base of the power in the equation; in our example, the growth factor is <m>g =  1.03</m>. The <alert>Percent Change Formula</alert> from Section 2.2 reminds us that <me>g=1 + r = 1+.03 =1.03</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s answer those questions. In 1957, we had <m>Y = 1957 - 1920 = 37</m> years and so <me>S = 800\ast1.03^{37} = 800 \times 1.03 \wedge \underline{37}= 2388.18134\ldots \approx \$\text{2,388}</me> By 1990, we had <m>Y = 1990 - 1920 = 70</m> years and so <me>S = 800\ast1.03^{70} = 800 \times 1.03 \wedge \underline{70}= 6334.2575\ldots \approx \$\text{6,334}</me> By 2015, we have <m>Y = 2015 - 1920 = 95</m> years and so <me>S = 800\ast1.03^{95} = 800 \times 1.03 \wedge \underline{95}= 13262.5286\ldots \approx \$\text{13,262}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s summarize this information in a table and draw a graph.

				Seems to around the year 2029, where <m>Y=109</m>, as we had guessed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Of course, we can solve the exponential equation instead. To find when <m>S= \text{20,000}</m> we use our equation <m>S = 800 \ast 1.03^Y</m> to get <me>800 \ast 1.03^Y =  \text{20,000}</me> Divide each side by 800 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{800} \ast 1.03^Y}{\cancel{800}} = \frac{ \text{20,000}}{800}</me> and so <me>1.03^Y = \frac{ \text{20,000}}{800}  =  \text{20,000} \div {800} = 25</me> Since we want to solve for the exponent, we use the <alert>Log-Divides Formula</alert> with growth factor <m>g=1.03</m> and the value <m>v= 25</m> to get <me>Y =  \frac{\log (v)}{\log(g)} =  \frac{\log (25)}{\log(1.03)} = \log (25) \div \log (1.03) = 108.89737 \approx 109</me> We rounded up to make sure it would reach the full $20,000. Since 1920 + 109 = 2029, we see (again) that the value should reach $20,000 in the year 2029.
			</p>

			<p>
				As an aside, look what happens when we calculate the rate of change for this function. For example, during the first five years, <me>\text{rate of change} =  \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\text{\$927} - \text{\$800}}{1925-1920}= \frac{\$127}{5 \text{ years}} = 127 \div 5 = \$25.40\text{/year}</me> and from 1925 to 1957, <me>\text{rate of change} =  \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\text{\$2,388} - \text{\$927}}{1957-1925}= \frac{\$\text{1,461}}{32 \text{ years}} = \text{1,461} \div 32 \approx \$45.66\text{/year}</me> In the first few years, the value increased an average of $25.40 a year, but from 1925 to 1957 it increased an average of about $45.66 per year.
			</p>

			<p>
				Were we supposed to get different numbers here? Well, the graph’s not a line and it’s not a linear equation. That tells us the rate of change isn’t going to be constant. So, sure, different numbers are fine. Does it make sense that the rate of change would itself increase? That the value increases at an increasing rate? Yes. Although we are always just adding on 3%, we’re taking 3% of larger numbers each year. So more is added each year.

			<title>Exponential growth and decay</title>

			<p>
				It is 2:00 a.m. and Joe is up studying. The dorm has quieted down, but Joe’s feeling mighty jittery. He drank 5 large mugs of coffee in the past few hours and all that caffeine is peaking in his system now. At around 200 mg per mug, Joe wonders when his caffeine levels will drop down to where he can sleep a little.
			</p>

			<p>
				First things first: staying up that late to study is probably a bad idea. I mean, who can think properly at 2:00 in the morning? And, how tired is Joe going to be by the time his test rolls around? Plus, we know that <me>5 \text{ mugs} \ast \frac{200 \text{ mg}}{\text{mug}} = 5 \times 200 = \text{1,000 mg}</me> which is a lot of caffeine, probably more than he needed to stay awake.
			</p>

			<p>
				At this point Joe is stuck so let’s help him. Let’s say that at 2:00 a.m. he has mg of caffeine in his blood. Joe searches online and discovers that 13% of the caffeine should leave his body each hour and below 300 mg he should be fine. When will that happen?
			</p>

			<p>
				We know how percent increase works, but here the caffiene is leaving his body according to a percent decrease. I guess we need to figure it out one step at a time. After one hour (by 3:00 a.m.), Joe will have <me>\text{1,000} \text{ mg} - 13 \% \text{ of }  \text{1,000} \text{ mg} =  \text{1,000}- .13 \times  \text{1,000} =  \text{1,000} - 130 = 870 \text{ mg}</me> By 4:00 a.m. (after 2 hours), Joe will have <me>870 \text{ mg} - 13 \% \text{ of } 870 \text{ mg} = 870 - .13 \times 870 = 870 - 113.1 =  756.9 \text{ mg}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute. When we calculated 13% decrease on mg we got 870 mg. That’s 87% of . Yeah, that’s right, take off 13% and you should be left with 87% of what you started with because <m>100\% - 13\% = 87\%</m>. So we could have calculated <me>.87 \times \text{1,000} = 870 \text{ mg}</me> and then <me>.87 \times 870 = 756.9 \text{ mg}</me> Aha, to find the amount after a 13% decrease we just multiply by .87.
			</p>

			<p>
				Still nowhere near 300 mg so fast-forward. For example, after 5 hours (at 7:00 a.m.), we need to multiply by .87 five times <me>1000 \ast .87 \ast .87 \ast .87 \ast .87 \ast .87=  \text{1,000} \ast .87^5</me> where we use a power to abbreviate repeatedly multiplying. So <me>1000 \ast .87^5 =  \text{1,000} \times .87 \wedge 5 = 498.420920\ldots \approx 498.4 \text{ mg}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				The bad news is that it’s 7:00 a.m. and Joe is still too jittery to sleep. The good news is that we can write the equation. The variables are
			</p>

			<p>
				Our equation must be <me>J = \text{1,000} \ast.87^H</me> Notice this equation fits our template for an exponential equation. <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } \ast \text{growth factor}^{\text{indep}}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				A little terminology here. When a function is exponential but decreasing, it’s called <term>exponential decay</term>. It sounds a little odd to say <q>growth factor</q> if the quantity is getting smaller so we sometimes say <term>decay factor</term> instead. We know from the <alert>Percent Change Formula</alert> that the growth factor (<m>g</m>) can be found from the growth rate (r) by the formula <m>g=1+r</m>. If we think of 13% decrease as negative growth rate, <m>r=-13\%=-.13</m>, then the formula still works to find the decay factor (<m>g</m>) <me>g= 1 + r = 1 + -.13 = 1-.13 = .87</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to jittery Joe. Let’s summarize what we’ve found and add a few more times to see when Joe’s caffeine level should fall below 300 mg.

			<p>
				That means Joe should be able to fall asleep by around 11:00 a.m. Exactly when his exam starts. Sorry, Joe.
			</p>

			<p>
				We could have solved the equation instead. We were looking for <m>J = 300</m>. Using our equation <m>J = \text{1,000} \ast .87^H</m> we get <me>\text{1,000} \ast .87^H=300</me> Divide each side to get <me>\frac{\cancel{\text{1,000}} \ast .87^H}{\cancel{\text{1,000}}}= \frac{300}{\text{1,000}}</me> which simplifies to <me>.87^H = \frac{300}{\text{1,000}} = 300 \div \text{1,000} = .3</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We find ourselves in the familiar situation – solving to find the exponent. Logs to the rescue. By the <alert>The Log-Divides Formula</alert> with growth factor <m>g=.87</m> and value <m>v= .3</m> we get <me>Y =  \frac{\log (v)}{\log(g)}=  \frac{\log (.3)}{\log(.87)} =  \log (.3) \div \log (.87) =  8.64537506\ldots \approx 9</me> which corresponds to 11:00 a.m. Same answer. Much quicker.
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick side note. We could have rounded to 8.64 hours and then converted units to get <me>.64 \text{ hours} \ast \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{1 \text{ hour}} = .64 \times 60 = 38.4 \approx 39 \text{ minutes}</me> Counting from 2:00 a.m., we see that Joe’s caffeine levels drop below 300 mg at 10:39 a.m. Since we are approximating throughout the problem, we should round to 11:00 a.m. anyway.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s calculate the rate of change and think about what it means. During the first hour, <me>\text{rate of change} =  \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} 
= \frac{870-\text{1,000 mg}}{\text{3:00 a.m.} - \text{2:00 a.m.}} = \frac{-130 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ hour}} = -130 \text{ mg/hour}</me> Was the rate of change supposed to be negative? Sure. Joe’s caffeine level is dropping. Any decreasing function has a negative rate of change. And, as exam time approaches, <me>\text{rate of change} =  \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}}  = \frac{285.5-328.2 \text{ mg}}{\text{11:00 a.m.} - \text{10:00 a.m.}} = \frac{-42.7 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ hour}} \approx -43 \text{ mg/hour}</me> Joe’s caffeine level was dropping faster at first and is not dropping as fast now.
			</p>

			<p>
				A glance at the graph confirms our findings.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<p>
				<image source='caffeine.png'/>
			</p><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				One last thing. There’s another way to describe the decrease here. When our story began Joe’s caffeine level was around mg and after 5 hours is was at 498.4 mg. That’s just about 500 mg, or half of what he started with. We say the <term>half-life</term> of caffeine is around 5 hours.
			</p>

			<p>
				Doesn’t sound very important but check this out. Start with mg. After 5 hours, there’s 500 mg left. (Okay, approximately.) Now go another 5 hours, which means 10 hours total. Evaluate our equation <m>J = \text{1,000} \ast .87^H</m> when <m>H =10</m> to get <me>J = \text{1,000} \ast .87^{10} = \text{1,000} \ast .87 \wedge \underline{10} = 248.423414\ldots \approx 250 \text{ mg}</me> That means half of what was left is now gone. Go another 5 hours. Lose another half. Check for yourself: <me>J = \text{1,000} \ast .87^{15} = \text{1,000} \ast .87 \wedge \underline{15} = 123.819426\ldots \approx 125 \text{ mg}</me> And so on. Cool.

				Obesity among children ages 6-11 continues to increase. From 1994 to 2010, the proportion of children classified as obese rose from an average of 1.1 out of every ten children in 1994 to around 2 out of every ten children in 2010.
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="footnotesize"-->
			<p>
				Source: Center for Disease Control and Prevention
			</p><!--</div attr= class="footnotesize">-->

			<p>
				Assuming that the prevalence of childhood obesity increases exponentially, what is the annual percent increase and what does the equation project for the year 2020? Well, unless we are able to make drastic improvements in how children eat and how much they exercise.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because we are told obesity is increasing exponentially we can use the template for an exponential equation. <me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } \ast \text{growth factor}^{\text{indep}}</me> The variables are
			</p>

<!-- div attr= class="center"-->
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor">
				<row left="minor" class="odd">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>C=</m> obese children (out of every ten) <m>\sim</m> dep</cell>
				</row>
				<row left="minor" class="even">
					<cell right="minor" halign="left"><m>Y =</m> year (years since 1994) <m>\sim</m> indep</cell>
				</row>
			</tabular><!--</div attr= class="center">-->

			<p>
				The starting amount is 1.1 children out of every ten in 1994 so our equation is of the form <me>C = 1.1 \ast g^Y</me> Trouble is we don’t actually know what the growth factor <m>g</m> is. Yet.
			</p>

			<p>
				We do know that in 2010 we have <m>Y = 2010 - 1994 = 16</m> years and <m>C = 2</m>. We can put those values into our equation to get <me>1.1 \ast g^{16}=2</me> No good reason for switching sides, just wanted to have the variable on the left. That’s supposed to be true but we don’t know what number <m>g</m> is so we can’t check. Argh.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh, wait a minute. The only unknown in that equation is the growth factor <m>g</m>. What if we solve for <m>g</m>? First, divide each side by 1.1 to get <me>\frac{\cancel{1.1}\ast g^{16}}{\cancel{1.1}} = \frac{2}{1.1}</me> which simplifies to <me>g^{16} = \frac{2}{1.1} = 2 \div 1.1= 1.818181818\ldots</me> Since we want to solve for the base (not the exponent), we have a power equation. We use the <alert>Root Formula</alert> with power <m>n=16</m> and value <m>v=1.818181818</m> to get <me>g = \sqrt[n]{v} = \sqrt[16]{1.818181818} = 16 \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 1.818181818 = 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Want a quicker way to find the growth factor? Forget the entire calculation we just did. It all boils down to two steps: <me>\frac{2}{1.1} = 2 \div 1.1 = 1.818181818\ldots</me> and then <me>g =  \sqrt[16]{1.818181818} = 16 \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} 1.818181818 = 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me> We can even do this calculation all at once as <me>g =  \sqrt[16]{\frac{2}{1.1}} = 16 \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}} (2 \div 1.1)= 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me> Notice we added parentheses because the normal order of operations would do the root first and division second. We wanted the division calculated before the root.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s the easy version in a formula.
			</p>

			<p>
				We knew from the beginning that our equation was in the form <m>C = 1.1 \ast g^Y</m>. Now that we found the growth factor <m>g \approx 1.0381</m> we get our final equation <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me> For example, we can check that in 2010, we have <m>Y=16</m> still and so <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^{16} = 1.1 \times 1.0381 \wedge \underline{16} =  2.000874004 \approx 2 \quad \checkmark</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				You might wonder why we didn’t just round off and use the equation <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.04^Y</me> Look what happens when we evaluate at <m>Y=16</m> then. We would get <me>C = 1.1 \ast1.04^{16} = 1.1 \times 1.04 \wedge \underline{16} = 2.06027937 \approx 2.1</me> Not a big difference (2.1 vs. 2.0) but enough to encourage us to keep extra digits in the growth factor in our equation. Lesson here is: don’t round off the growth factor too much.
			</p>

			<p>
				Back to the more reliable equation <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me> We can now answer the two questions. First, in 2020 we have <m>Y = 2020-1994 = 26</m> and so <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^{26} = 1.1 \times 1.0381 \wedge \underline{26} = 2.908115507 \approx 2.9</me> According to our equation, by 2020 there would be approximately 2.9 obese children for every ten children.
			</p>

			<p>
				The other question was what the annual percent increase is. Think back to an earlier example. Remember that Jocelyn was analyzing health care costs in Section 2.2? They began at $2.26 million and grew 6.7% per year. She had the equation <me>H=2.26\ast1.067^Y</me> So the growth factor <m>g=1.067</m> in the equation came from the growth rate <m>r=6.7\%=.067</m>. Our equation modeling childhood obesity is <me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me> The growth factor of <m>g=1.0381</m> in our equation must come must come from the growth rate <m>r= .0381=3.81\%</m>. Think of it as converting to percent <m>1.0381 = 103.81 \%</m> and then ignoring the 100% to see the 3.81% increase. Childhood obesity has increased around 3.81% each year. Well, on average.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s the general formula relating the growth rate and growth factor.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s check. We have <m>g=1.0381</m> and so the growth rate is <me>r=g-1 = 1.0381-1 = .0381= 3.81\%</me> Not sure we really need these formulas, but there you have it.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, formula works just fine if a quantity decreases by a fixed percent. One example we saw was Joe, who drank too much coffee. The growth (or should I say decay) factor was <m>g=.87</m>. That corresponds to a growth (decay) rate of <me>r=g-1=.87-1=-.13=-13\%</me> Again, the negative means that we have a percent decrease.

			<p>
				But what’s the equation? Hmm. Don’t know for sure what type of equation might work here. Tell you what, let’s compare what a linear and exponential model would tell us about the value of the car.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, linear. The template is <me>\textsc{Linear Equation Template: \quad} \text{dep} = \text{start}+\text{slope}\ast\text{indep}</me> The starting value of Sofía’s car is $ so we just need to find the slope. We expect the slope to be negative because her car is worth less the more she drives it. <me>\begin{aligned}
 \text{slope} &amp; = &amp;\text{rate of change} = \frac{\text{change dep}}{\text{change indep}} = \frac{\$\text{5,700}-\$\text{22,500}}{109 \text{ thousand miles}} =   \frac{-\$\text{16,800}}{109\text{ thousand miles}}\\ \\
 &amp; = &amp; \text{(-)16,800} \div 109 = -154.1284404\ldots \approx -\$\text{154/thousand miles} \\
\end{aligned}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Her car loses value at a rate of around $154 for each thousand miles she drives.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are ready to write the linear equation. <me>\textbf{linear:} \quad C = \text{22,500} - 154M</me> As usual we wrote this with subtraction instead of adding the negative slope. Quick check: when <m>M=109</m> we get <me>C =  \text{22,500} - 154\ast 109 =  \text{22,500} - 154\times \underline{109}= \text{5,714} \approx \$\text{5,700} \quad \checkmark</me> Remember we don’t expect the exact answer because we rounded off the slope.
			</p>

				When will Sofía’s car be worth under $500 according to this linear equation? Let’s solve to find out. When <m>C=500</m>, use our linear equation to get <me>\text{22,500} - 154M =500</me> Subtract from each side and simplify to get <me>-154M= -\text{22,000}</me> Now divide each side by -154 and simplify to get <me>M = \frac{-\text{22,000}}{-154} = \text{(-) 22,000} \div  \text{(-)}154= 142.738095\ldots \approx 143</me> According to the linear equation, Sofía’s car will be worth under $500 at about miles. Since her car already has miles on it, that means in another <m>\text{143,000}-\text{109,000} = \text{34,000 miles}</m>. For a typical driver that’s two or three more years.
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, let’s take a look at the exponential model. Here goes. The template is <me>\textsc{Exponential Equation Template:} \quad \text{dep }=\text{ start } \ast \text{growth factor}^{\text{indep}}</me> We know everything except the growth factor. We expect it to be less than 1 because her car is worth less the more she drives it. Perhaps we should say <q>decay</q> factor here since the function is decreasing. The starting amount is <m>s=\text{22,500}</m> and the ending amount is <m>a=\text{5,700}</m> after <m>t=109</m> thousand miles. By the <alert>Growth Factor Formula</alert> we have <me>g = \sqrt[t]{\frac{a}{s}} = \sqrt[109]{\frac{\text{5,700}}{\text{22,500}}}
= 109  \sqrt[x]{\text{\raisebox{.6em}{~\text{  }}}}( \text{5,700} \div \text{22,500})= 0.98748222\ldots \approx .9875</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We are ready to write the exponential equation. <me>\textbf{exponential:} \quad C = \text{22,500} \ast .9875^M</me> Quick check: when <m>M=109</m> we get <me>C =  \text{22,500} \ast .9875^{109} =  \text{22,500} \times .9875 \wedge\underline{109}= 5711.19365\ldots \approx \$\text{5,700} \quad \checkmark</me> Again, we don’t expect the exact answer because we rounded off the decay factor.
			</p>

			<p>
				When will Sofía’s car be worth under $500 according to this exponential equation? Let’s solve to find out. When <m>C=500</m>, use our exponential equation to get <me>\text{22,500} \ast .9875^M =500</me> Divide each side by and simplify to get <me>.9875^M= \frac{500}{\text{22,500}} = 500 \div \text{22,500} = .02222222\ldots</me> By the <alert>The Log-Divides Formula</alert> with growth factor <m>g=.9875</m> and the value <m>v= .02222222</m> we get <me>M =  \frac{\log (v)}{\log(g)}=  \frac{\log (.022222222)}{\log(.9875)} =  \log (.02222222) \div \log (.9875) = 302.6256856 \approx 300</me> According to the exponential equation, Sofía’s car will be worth under $500 at about miles. Hard to imagine the car would last that long. Essentially the exponential model says the car will always be worth at least $500, if only for parts, I guess. Quite different from our answer from the linear equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Time to compare models. Which one makes more sense? First things first, the car already has a lot of miles on it. Don’t know what make or model the car is, but another couple of years seems a reasonable time until is worth under $500. That’s what the linear equation projects. On the other hand, the exponential model project it will hold that value for a long time, essentially for parts. That makes sense too.
			</p>

			<p>
				Wait a minute. Does a car lose the same value for each thousand miles it’s driven? That’s what it means to be linear. Every thousand miles, same decrease. Nah, that’s not right. Once the car is old, another miles or so probably won’t affect the value at all. Also, when a car is new, once you drive it off the lot and then that strange vinyl smell wears off and it’s officially <q>used,</q> the car is worth a lot less. Even if it hasn’t been driven much at all. What would each model say the car was worth soon after Sofía bought it, say with miles on it? With <m>M=10</m>, the estimates are

				A flu virus has been spreading through the college dormitories. Initially 8 students were diagnosed with the flu, but that number has been growing rapidly. After 2 weeks, there were 64 students with the flu. We are interested in predicting how many students will catch the flu over the next 6 weeks or so. To get a sense of scale, there are students currently living in the dorms.

				One model estimates that the number of students diagnosed with the flu was growing 16% per day. (If this story sounds familiar, it’s because the story also appears in the practice exercises 2.2 #3 and 5.1 #2.) The corresponding equation is <me>\textbf{exponential:} \quad F = 8 \ast 1.16^D</me> As a check, at 14 days there were <me>F = 8 \ast 1.16^{14} = 8 \times 1.16 \wedge \underline{14} = 63.900143\ldots \approx 64 \text{ students}</me> We rounded the numbers in our table to the nearest person.

				While at first the exponential model seems reasonable, it quickly gets too large to make sense. After all, there are only students currently living in the dorms so the numbers we found at 5 and 6 weeks (also known as 35 and 42 days) are totally unrealistic. The exponential model is based on the assumption that the rate of change of the number of new cases is proportional to the number of <term>infected</term> students: those who already have the flu.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are both advantages and disadvantages of the exponential model. To it’s credit, the exponential model captures the reality of the first few weeks, where the flu spreads very rapidly. But, the exponential model misses several basic facts. First, as more students catch the flu, the number of new cases decreases in part because sick people are already surrounded by sick people so there aren’t new people to get sick. Second, for whatever reasons, not everyone is going to catch the flu no matter how exposed they are. We would like to have an alternative model that keeps what works (rapid increase at first) but deals better with the long term (the growth slows down and not everyone catches the flu). There are two different models we consider that have these properties: saturation and logistic.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first example is a <term>saturation</term> model. Basically it assumes that the rate of change of the number of new cases is proportional to the number of <term>susceptible</term> students: those who are likely to catch the flu but haven’t already. Since at the beginning many susceptible students don’t have the flu, it spreads very quickly, even faster than the exponential does. But once most susceptible students have caught the flu, the number of new cases dwindles.
			</p>

			<p>
				Leaving out the details of how we found it, a possible saturation equation for our example is <me>\textbf{saturation:} \quad F=96-88\ast.93^D</me> As a check, initially there were <me>F = 96-88 \ast .93^0 = 96 - 88 \times .93 \wedge \underline{0} = 8 \text{ students} \quad \checkmark</me> and at 14 days there were <me>F = 96-88 \ast .93^{14} = 96 - 88 \times .93 \wedge \underline{14} =64.1401334\ldots \approx 64 \quad \checkmark</me> We rounded the numbers in our table to the nearest person.

			<p>
				The saturation model predicts that 92 students (total) will have (or have had) the flu over the next 6 weeks.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second example is a <term>logistic</term> (or <term>S-curve</term>) model. Basically it assumes that the rate of change of the number of new cases is jointly proportional to the number of infected students and the number of susceptible students. It acknowledges the heavy influence the number of infected students have initially on the growth, but balances it with the limiting influence of the diminishing number of susceptible students over time.
			</p>

			<p>
				It turns out that a possible logistic equation for our example is <me>\textbf{logistic:} \quad F=\frac{129}{1+15 \ast .825^D}</me> For example, initially there were <me>F = \frac{129}{1+15\ast .825^0} = 129 \div ( 1 + 15 \times .825 \wedge \underline{0}) = 
8.0625000\ldots \approx 8 \text{ students} \quad \checkmark</me> and at 14 days there were <me>F = \frac{129}{1+15\ast .825^{14}} = 129 \div ( 1 + 15 \times .825 \wedge \underline{14}) = 64.0212993\ldots \approx 64 \text{ students} \quad \checkmark</me> Notice how we need parentheses around the bottom of our fraction, as usual, to override the normal order of operations. We rounded the numbers in the table to the nearest person.

				As you can see from the graph, both the saturation and logistic curves level off as expected. One way to estimate those <term>limiting values</term> (or <term>carrying capacity</term>) is to evaluate the functions at large values, say 60 days, 100 days, and (the unrealistic) days.

				We crossed out the unrealistic values from the exponential equation. So, if the saturation model is accurate, then we should expect around 96 total cases. But, if the logistic model is accurate, then we should expect around 129 total cases instead.

									<p>
										In our example in this section, we made several tables of values. Go back and check that they are correct.
									</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
										Mari volunteers answering calls for in the office of her local state government representative. The office has been receiving a lot of calls recently with about BPA, a chemical found in plastics. The callers want their representative to support a bill banning BPA. An equation that describes the number of total number of calls over time is the following: <me>C=\frac{837}{1+118\ast .8025^D}</me> where <m>D</m> is the time since January 1 (in days), and <m>C</m> is the total number of calls.
									</p>
					
									<p><ol>
										<li>
														<p>
															According to this equation, how many calls (total) will Mari’s office get by February 1 (day 31), March 1 (day 59), April 1 (day 90), May 1 (day 120), and Nov 8 (day 311)?
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															During which months did most of the calls come in?
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															Draw a graph illustrating the function.
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															Describe what happened over time.
														</p>
										</li>
					
									</ol></p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
										Even though all the callers support the bill, Mari isn’t sure whether the calls represent the local constituents. Perhaps only supporters are calling her office, for example. So, she asks her pollster, Paul, to add this question to the list for his daily survey. Based on that survey, Paul estimates the percentage <m>P</m> of local constituents who support the bill on day <m>D</m> by the equation <me>P =100 - 87.3 \ast .992^D</me>
									</p>
					
									<p><ol>
										<li>
														<p>
															According to this equation, what percentage of callers supported the bill on January 1 (day 0), March 1 (day 59), Aug 1 (day 212), Oct 1 (day 273) and Nov 8 (day 311)?
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															What does your equation say the percentage would be on day 500 (which probably isn’t realistic in this problem)? How about day ?
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															Use successive approximations to estimate when the percentage supporting the bill first reached majority (50%).
														</p>
										</li>

										Infants are regularly checked to make sure they are growing accordingly. The World Health Organization publishes growth charts to evaluate infant weight <m>W</m> in kilograms at a given age <m>M</m> in months since birth. An equation that describes an average infant boy is the following: <me>W=15-11.5\ast.932^M</me>
									</p>
					
									<p><ol>
										<li>
														<p>
															According to this equation, what is the average infant boy weight at birth, 1 month, 4 months, and a year?
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															Convert your answers to pounds and ounces using <me>1 \text{ kilogram } \approx 2.2 \text{ pounds} \quad \text{ and } \quad 1 \text{ pound } = 16 \text{ ounces}</me> <em>Hint: first convert to pounds. Then convert just the decimal part to ounces.</em>
														</p>
										</li>
					
										<li>
														<p>
															The equation is valid for <m>0 \le M \le 36</m>, or up to three years old. Draw a graph that includes your points from earlier and the values at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years. Can you explain why the equation doesn’t make sense after around 3 years?

										The lake by Rodney’s condo was stocked with bass (fish) 10 years ago. There were initially 400 bass introduced. The carrying capacity of the lake is estimated at bass. Two potential models for the number of bass (<m>B</m>) over time, where <m>Y</m> measures the years from when the lake was stocked 10 years ago are
