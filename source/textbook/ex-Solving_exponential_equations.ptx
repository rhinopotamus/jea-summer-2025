	<exercise xml:id="hair-color-solving-exponential" component="web">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Darcy likes to use temporary hair color in wild colors. Good thing it washes out. Her best guess is that 8% of the color washes out each time she washes her hair. That means the percentage of color remaining, <m>C</m>, is a function of the number of times she washes her hair, <m>W</m>, according to the equation <me>C=100 \ast 0.92^W</me>

		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					By the time only 10% of the color remains you really can't tell anymore if it was pink or orange or blue. So, she might as well switch to a new color then. How many washes before only 10% remains? Again, first solve. Then check.
