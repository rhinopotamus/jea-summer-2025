            On each problem, write down what you enter into your calculator and don't forget to write the units on your final answer. You are welcome to calculate the answer step-by-step but challenge yourself to figure out the answer all at once, not hitting <m>=</m> on your calculator until the very end.

                    As I write this problem, the population of the world is 8,056,959,718 people (just over 8 billion). It changes by the second, so let's use the round figure of 8,100,000,000.

                    The intersection by my house is dangerous. One year there were 14 accidents there. The neighbors got together and petitioned to have 4-way stop signs installed.
