		<introduction>
			<p>
				Suppose a car gas tank is designed to hold enough fuel to drive 350 miles. (That is fairly average.) That means the size tank, <m>G</m> gallons, is a function of the fuel efficiency, <m>F</m> miles per gallon (mpg), according to the equation
				<me>
					\displaystyle G = \frac{350}{F}
				</me>
				<em>(Story also appears in 2.4 #2)</em>

		</introduction>
		<task>
			<statement>
				<p>
					My Honda Accord's tank holds about 16 gallons. According to the equation, what is the corresponding fuel efficiency? Set up and solve the equation. Start solving by multiplying both sides by <m>F</m>. <em>Note: you will not need to take a root.</em>

	<exercise xml:id="effective-return-solving-power" workspace="2in">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Moose bought a commemorative football jersey for $150 twelve years ago. Now he is planning to sell it and is interested in what the <term>effective return</term> (equivalent annual percent increase) on his investment might be for various prices. If $<m>J</m> is the current value of the jersey and <m>g</m> is the annual growth factor, then <me>J=150\, g^{12}</me> For each part, first solve for <m>g</m> using the <term>Root Formula</term>, then calculate <m>r=g-1</m>. The effective return is <m>r</m> written as a percentage.
