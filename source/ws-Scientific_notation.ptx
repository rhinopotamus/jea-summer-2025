                    Bunnies, bunnies, everywhere. In 2007 there were 1800 and that number was predicted to increase 13% each year. I was trying to predict the number of rabbits in 2023 (after 16 years) but I accidentally typed in 166 years by mistake: <me>1800 \ast 1.13 \wedge 166=</me> Report the answer I got in scientific notation. (Yes, this is a gigantic number. The exponential model I used doesn't actually make sense for that many years.)

                    A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decreases by 2% each mile it travels. We can calculate the signal strength after 1000 miles by evaluating <me>0.98 \wedge 1000=</me> Report the answer you get in scientific notation. (Yes, this is a teeny number. In reality there would be signal booster installed along the route.) <em>Story also appears in 5.2 #1</em>
