                Jody is using small wooden balls to make noses for her knitted gnomes. She figured out that she can calculate the weight of each ball (in ounces) as <m>0.2 \times B \land 3</m> where <m>B</m> is the diameter of the ball (in inches). <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="wooden-balls-algebraic-notation"/>)</em>

                    Jody is considering building a giant gnome for her office. The nose will be a wooden ball weighing 1 pound. She calculates that the diameter of the ball will be <m>\sqrt[3]{80}</m>. How big is that?

            <p>
                The size of a round pizza is described by its diameter. It turns out that we can calculate how many people are served by a pizza of diameter <m>D</m> inches as <m>0.015625 \times D \land 2=</m>. For example, a 16-inch diameter pizza serves <m>0.015625 \times 16 \land 2 = 4</m> people. (The mysterious number 0.015625 comes from a little geometry and pizza science.)

                A signal sent down a fiber optic cable decreases by 2% per mile. That means after <m>M</m> miles, its strength is <m>\underbrace{0.98 \times 0.98 \times \cdots \times 0.98}_{M \text{ times}} = 0.98 \land M</m>. What is the signal strength after 10 miles? After 20 miles? Note: your answers should be decimal numbers less than 1.
