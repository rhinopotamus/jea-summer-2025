				There are 2,624 students at a local university.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Of those students, 673 of those students placed into this algebra class. What fraction of students placed into algebra?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The Dean said that approximately 1 in 4 students, or <m>\frac{1}{4}</m> of all students, placed into algebra. Is that correct? Check by determining if your answer to part (a) <m>\approx \frac{1}{4}</m> by comparing decimal approximations.

				Gas mileage is usually rounded down to the nearest one decimal place. Gas mileage is measured in miles per gallon (mpg).

				Xu does gig work delivering take-out food from local restaurants. He started the week with a full tank of gas and drove 319 miles. When he went to fill the tank, he needed 11.3 gallons. What was Xus gas mileage?

				In January 2015, Graham had 47 albums in his vinyl collection. By September 2023 (that’s 8 years, 9 months later), he had 783 albums. Approximately how many albums per month did Graham buy?
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				Figure out the answer step by step.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now try to combine all of your calculations into one line on your calculator. Hint: write as a fraction first.

				It took Mariam 3 hours to complete the reading for her Religion class. The reading was 102 pages long.
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				How fast did she read measured in pages per hour? Write the answer as a fraction and as a decimal.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Reading speed is often measured in words per minute. Assuming there are approximately 500 words per page, calculate Mariam’s reading speed step by step.

				How could you do the calculation in part (b) one line on your calculator by using parentheses? Hint: the <q>hours</q> cancel!

				Do the textbook exercises and check your answers. Not sure if you are close enough? Compare answers with a classmate or ask your instructor or tutor.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>

				Getting the wrong answers or stuck? Re-read the section and try again. If you are still stuck, work with a classmate or go to your instructor’s office hours or tutor hours.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.
