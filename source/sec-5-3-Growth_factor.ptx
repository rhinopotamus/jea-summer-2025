			If someone gives us two points on a graph, we can figure out a linear equation that goes through both of them: we just use the <xref ref="rate-of-change" text="title"/> to figure out the slope, and then <xref ref="intercept-formula" text="custom">figure out the intercept</xref>. Turns out we can do a similar process to figure out an exponential equation that goes through any two points.
		</p>
		<p>
			An important part of this process will be to solve a power equation, so let's remind ourselves how this works.

		<title>Childhood obesity</title>
		
		
		<p>
			Obesity among children ages 6-11 continues to increase. From 1994 to 2010, the proportion of children classified as obese rose from an average of 1.1 out of every ten children in 1994 to around 2 out of every ten children in 2010.

		</p>

		<p>
			Assuming that the prevalence of childhood obesity increases exponentially, what is the annual percent increase and what does the equation project for the year 2020? Well, unless we are able to make drastic improvements in how children eat and how much they exercise.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because we are told obesity is increasing exponentially we can use the template for an exponential equation. 
			<me>\text{dep }=\text{ start } \ast \text{growth factor}^{\text{indep}}</me> 
			The variables are
			<md>
				<mrow>C \amp= \text{ obese children (out of every ten) } \sim \text{ dep} </mrow>
				<mrow>Y \amp= \text{ time (years since 1994) } \sim \text{ indep} </mrow>
			</md>
			Why did we choose to measure time in years since 1994? Since we were given a value of our function in the year 1994, it's helpful for us to choose 1994 as <m>Y = 0</m>, so that the value we are given is the <alert>starting</alert> value -- that is, <q>start</q> in our exponential equation template.
		</p>

		<p>
			With this choice of variables, we can organize the information we know into a table. Do you see why 2010 corresponds to <m>Y = 16</m>?
			<tabular bottom="minor" top="minor" row-headers="yes" halign="center">

		<title>Finding the growth factor</title>

		<p>
			Back to our childhood obesity story. Let's figure out an equation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of our clever setup that the variable <m>Y</m> is measured in years since 1994, the starting amount is 1.1 children out of every ten.
			So, our equation will look like
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast g^Y</me>. 
			Trouble is we don't actually know what the growth factor <m>g</m> is. 
			To figure it out, we can use the second piece of information in our table: when <m>Y = 16</m>, we know that <m>C = 2</m>.
			We can put those values into our equation to get 
			<me>1.1 \ast g^{16}=2</me>. 
			No particular reason for switching sides, just wanted to have the variable on the left. That's supposed to be true but we don't know what number <m>g</m> is so we can't check. Argh.
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh, wait a minute. The only unknown in that equation is the growth factor <m>g</m>. What if we solve for <m>g</m>? First, divide each side by 1.1 to get 
			<me>\frac{\cancel{1.1}\ast g^{16}}{\cancel{1.1}} = \frac{2}{1.1}</me>, 
			which simplifies to 
			<me>g^{16} = \frac{2}{1.1} = 2 \div 1.1= 1.818181818\ldots</me> 
			What kind of equation is this? Since the thing we want to solve for is the base (not the exponent), we have a power equation. We use the <xref ref="root-formula" text="title"/> with power <m>n=16</m> and value <m>v=1.818181818</m> to get 
			<me>g = \sqrt[n]{v} = \sqrt[16]{1.818181818} = 16 \sqrt[x]{~\text{  }} 1.818181818 = 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Want a quicker way to find the growth factor? The entire calculation we just did all boils down to two steps: 
			<me>\frac{2}{1.1} = 2 \div 1.1 = 1.818181818\ldots</me> 
			and then 
			<me>g =  \sqrt[16]{1.818181818} = 16 \sqrt[x]{~\text{  }} 1.818181818 = 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me>. 
			We can even do this calculation all at once: 
			<me>g =  \sqrt[16]{\frac{2}{1.1}} = 16 \sqrt[x]{~\text{  }} (2 \div 1.1)= 1.038071653 \approx 1.0381</me>. 
			Notice we added parentheses because the normal order of operations would do the root first and division second. We wanted the division calculated before the root.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's the shortcut version in a formula.
		</p>

		<assemblage xml:id="growth-factor-formula">
			<title>Growth Factor Formula</title>
				
				
			<p>
				If a quantity is growing (or decaying) exponentially, then the growth (or decay) factor is 
				<me>\displaystyle g = \sqrt[t]{\frac{a}{s}}</me>, 
				where <m>s</m> is the starting amount and <m>a</m> is the amount after <m>t</m> time periods.

		<title>Checking our formula (and rounding)</title>

		<p>
			In our childhood obesity story, we knew from the beginning that our equation was in the form <m>C = 1.1 \ast g^Y</m>. Now that we found the growth factor <m>g \approx 1.0381</m> we get our final equation 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me>. 
			For example, we can check that in 2010, we have <m>Y=16</m> still and so 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^{16} = 1.1 \times 1.0381 \wedge \underline{16} =  2.000874004 \approx 2 \quad \checkmark</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			You might wonder why we didn't just round off and use the equation 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.04^Y</me>. 
			Look what happens when we evaluate at <m>Y=16</m> then. We would get 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast1.04^{16} = 1.1 \times 1.04 \wedge \underline{16} = 2.06027937 \approx 2.1</me>. 
			Not a big difference (2.1 vs. 2.0) but enough to encourage us to keep extra digits in the growth factor in our equation. Lesson here is: <em>don't round off the growth factor too much.</em>

	<subsection component="not-workbook" xml:id="ss-5-3-percent-change">
		<title>Finding percent change from growth factor</title>

		<p>
			Back to the less harshly rounded equation 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me>. 
			We can now answer the two questions. First, in 2020 we have <m>Y = 2020-1994 = 26</m> and so 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^{26} = 1.1 \times 1.0381 \wedge \underline{26} = 2.908115507 \approx 2.9</me>. 
			According to our equation, by 2020 there would be approximately 2.9 obese children for every ten children.
		</p>

		<p>
			The other question was what the annual percent increase is. Think back to an earlier example. Remember that Jocelyn was analyzing health care costs in Section 2.2? They began at $2.26 million and grew 6.7% per year. She had the equation 
			<me>H=2.26\ast1.067^Y</me>. 
			So the growth factor <m>g=1.067</m> in the equation came from the growth rate <m>r=6.7\%=0.067</m>. Our equation modeling childhood obesity is 
			<me>C = 1.1 \ast 1.0381^Y</me>. 
			The growth factor of <m>g=1.0381</m> in our equation must come from the growth rate <m>r= 0.0381=3.81\%</m>. Think of it as converting to percent <m>1.0381 = 103.81 \%</m> and then ignoring the 100% to see the 3.81% increase. Childhood obesity has increased around 3.81% each year. Well, on average.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's the general formula relating the growth rate and growth factor.
		</p>

		<assemblage xml:id="percent-change-formula">
			<title>Percent Change Formula</title>
				
				
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							If a quantity changes by a percentage corresponding to growth rate <m>r</m>, then the growth factor is <me>\displaystyle g=1+r</me>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the growth factor is <m>g</m>, then the growth rate is <me>r = g-1</me>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Let's check. We have <m>g=1.0381</m> and so the growth rate is 
			<me>r=g-1 = 1.0381-1 = 0.0381= 3.81\%</me>. 
			Not sure we really need these formulas, but there you have it.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the way, formula works just fine if a quantity decreases by a fixed percent. One example we saw was Joe, who drank too much coffee. The growth (or should I say decay) factor was <m>g=0.87</m>. That corresponds to a growth (decay) rate of 
			<me>r=g-1=0.87-1=-0.83=-13\%</me>. 
			Again, the negative means that we have a percent decrease.
