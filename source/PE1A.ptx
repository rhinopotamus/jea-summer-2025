			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you’re not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don’t spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you’re not sure about something.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don’t forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>

			Arva and Ellie began hiking at an elevation of feet and climbed at the steady rate of 600 vertical feet per hour.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing their elevation after 1 hour, 2 hours, and 5 hours.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables, including units.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Explain the dependence using a sentence of the form <q> is a function of .</q>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Is the function increasing or decreasing?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			How long does it take them to reach feet up? Try to figure out the answer in hours and minutes (H:MM format).

			Pramesh’s new car used 20.5 gallons of gas for a 715 mile trip.

			How many miles per gallon (mpg) does his car get?

			Ndwiga is reading an article in the paper about atoms. From his physics textbook he discovered that the size of an atom is .142 nanometers. (That’s 0.142 nanometers.)
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Write the size of an atom in meters. Use <m>1 \text{ meter} = \text{1,000,000,000 nanometers}</m>. Write your answer in usual decimal notation and in scientific notation.

			Ndwiga would like to know how many atoms across this sheet of paper which is 8.5 inches wide. Use that <m>1 \text{ inch} \approx 2.54 \text{ cm}</m> and <m>1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ cm}</m>. Express your final answer in billions of atoms.
