		<title>Exponential growth and decay – Practice exercises</title>

			A signal is sent down a fiber optic cable. Its strength decrease by 2% each mile it travels. (Say it was one unit strong to start.)
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing the strength of the signal over the first five miles.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables, including units, and write an equation relating them.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The signal will need a <term>booster</term> (something to make the signal stronger again) when it has fallen to under .75 units. How far along the cable should the booster be placed? Set up and solve an equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			  <em>The problem continues …</em>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What is the half-life (or should we say half-distance) of a signal? That means, how far can it travel without dropping below 50%? (That will not actual happen because we would boost the signal.) Again, set up and solve an equation.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph illustrating the relationship.

			A recent news report stated that cell phone usage is growing exponentially in developing countries. In one small country, people owned a cell phone in the year 2000. It was estimated that usage would increase at 1.4% percent per year.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables including units.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Assuming the growth is exponential, write an equation for the function.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			At this rate, how many years would it take for the number of people owning a cell phone to double? That is called the <term>doubling time</term>. Show how to set up and solve an equation to find the answer.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			In 2011, about people owned a cellphone. Is that count higher or lower than predicted from your equation? Explain.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Based on the 2011 data, would you say that cell phone usage was growing slower or faster than 1.4%?
		</p>

			If a person has a heart attack and his or her heart stops beating, the amount of time it takes paramedics to restart his or her heart with a defibrillator is critical. Each minute that passes decreases the person’s chance of survival by 10%. Assume that this statement means the decrease is exponential and that the survival rate is 100% if the defibrillator is used immediately.

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables and write an equation.

			<li>
					<p>
			If it takes the paramedics 2 minutes to use the defibrillator, what is the person’s chance of survival?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			When does the survival rate drop below 50%? Use successive approximation to estimate to the nearest minute. Display your guesses in a table.

			You and two buddies each invite 10 people to <q>like</q> your online group. Suppose everyone accepts and then they each invite 10 people. And then everyone accepts and they each invite 10 people. And so on. Of course, there is likely to be substantial overlap, but for the moment pretend that there is not any overlap.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			There are 3 friends to start. In the first round they each invite 10 friends, so a total of 30 new people <q>like</q> your online group in the first round. How many new people <q>like</q> your group in the second round? The third?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables and write an equation showing how the number of new people increases in each round. Think of the original 3 friends as round 0.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing this information. Continue your table to include the number of new people who <q>like</q> your group in the fourth and fifth rounds.

			What is the <em>total</em> number of people who <q>like</q> your online group after five rounds. <em>Hint: add</em>

					<p>
			Getting the wrong answers or stuck? Re-read the section and try again. If you are still stuck, work with a classmate or go to your instructor’s office hours or tutor hours.

			It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.
