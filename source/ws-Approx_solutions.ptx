		<introduction>
			<p>
				The size of a round pizza is described by its <term>diameter</term> (distance across). Assuming a 16-inch diameter pizza serves four people, and with a little geometry to help us out, we calculated that a pizza of diameter <m>D</m> inches serves <m>P</m> people, where

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Suppose the gas tank of a car is designed to hold enough fuel to drive 350 miles. (That's fairly average.) A hybrid car with fuel efficiency of 50 miles per gallon (mpg) would only need a 7 gallon gas tank, but a recreational vehicle that gets only 10 mpg would need a 35 gallon gas tank. <em>(Story also appears in <xref ref="fuel-350-solving-power"/>)</em>
