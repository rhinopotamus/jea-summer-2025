	<exercise xml:id="temperature-intercepts">
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In each of the following stories, the temperature changes over time. It might be confusing to call either variable <m>T</m>, so use <m>H</m> for the time in hours and <m>D</m> for the temperature in degrees (°F). In each case, time should be measured from the start of the story.

					It was really cold at 8:30 this morning when Raina arrived at the office. Luckily the heating system warms things up very quickly, 4°F per hour. By 11:00 a.m. it was a very comfortable 72°F.

					While 72°F is a perfectly good temperature for an office, not so for ballroom dancing. When Raina arrived for her practice at 5:30 that evening, she began to sweat before she even took the floor. Turns out the air conditioner had been running since 4:00 p.m. but it only cools down the room 3°F per hour.
