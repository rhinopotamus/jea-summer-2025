				Rent in the Riverside Neighborhood is expected to increase 7.2% each year. 
				Average rent for an apartment is currently $830 per month. 
				<em>(Story also appears in 3.4 #3)</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Identify and name the variables, including the units.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Explain the dependence using a sentence of the form <q>__ is a function of __</q>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Which number is a constant in this story: 
							the percent increase (7.2) or the apartment rent (830)?
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							What is a realistic domain for this function? 
							That means, for how many years might this sort of increase in rent continue? 
							Express your answer as an inequality.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							What is the average rent expected to be in 1 year? In 2 years? In 3 years? 
							Note that <me>7.2\% = \frac{7.2}{100} = 7.2 \div 100 = 0.072</me>. Try figuring it out.

				Round each number up, down, or off to the precision indicated.

							My calculations show I need a cross brace around 9.388 feet long.

							Gas mileage is usually rounded down to the nearest one decimal place. 
							What is the gas mileage for a car measured as getting 42.812 miles per gallon? 
							What about a car getting 23.09 miles per gallon?
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The original budget estimates for the new community center gym were 
							rounded to the nearest hundred (that means ending in <m>00</m>), 
							so we want to round our bid of $148,214.79 to the nearest hundred.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							The population estimate was 4.2 million people, 
							but revised estimates suggest 4,908,229 people. 
							Report the revised estimate rounded appropriately.
