			We know 5 city blocks and 5 miles are very different lengths to walk; $5 and 5¢ are very different values of money; 5 minutes and 5 years are very different amounts of time to wait - even though all of these quantities are represented by the number 5. Every variable is measured in terms of some <term>unit</term>. Since there are often several different units available to use, it is important when naming a variable to state which units we are choosing to measure it in.

		<title>Unit conversion fractions</title>

		<p>
			In <xref ref="sec-1-3-Rate_of_change" text="type-global"/> we examined the height of a springboard diver and her speed in the air. But, how high is 3 meters? How fast is 4.4 meters per second?
		</p>

		<p>
			The metric unit of length called a meter is just over 3 feet (a yard). Let's use <me>1 \text{ meter} \approx 3.281 \text{ feet}</me>
			This math sentence means that 1 meter is (approximately) the same as 3.281 feet.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since 1 meter and 3.281 feet are just two different ways of saying (approximately) the same distance, here are two more math sentences we can write down:
			<me>
				\dfrac{1 \text{ meter}}{3.281 \text{ feet}} \approx 1
				\quad \text{and} \quad
				\dfrac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ meter}} \approx 1
			</me>
			A fraction where the top and bottom are equal quantities expressed in different units is sometimes called a <term>unit conversion fraction</term>. Because it's equal to 1 (or at least very close to 1), multiplying by the unit conversion fraction doesn't change the value, just the units.
			<aside>
				<p>
					1 is the very special number that doesn't change the value of any number it's multiplied by. The fancy mathematical term for this is the "multiplicative identity." 
				</p>
				<p>
					The key thing to remember about unit conversion fractions is that, although they look complicated, they are just a <m>1</m> with a cheap disguise on.

				</p>
			</aside>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's illustrate: we can use a unit conversion fraction to change 3 meters to feet. <me>3 \text{ meters} \ast  \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ meter}} = 3 \times 3.281 = 9.843 \text{ feet} \approx 9.8 \text{ feet}</me> Since our conversion is just approximate, we rounded off our answer too.
		</p>

		<p>
			You might wonder how we knew to choose the unit conversion fraction that has the feet on the top and the meters on the bottom. One reminder for how this works is to think fractions. It's like the meters on the top and bottom cancel, leaving the units as feet. <me>\frac{3 \cancel{\text{ meters}}}{1} \ast  \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \cancel{\text{ meter}}} = 3 \times 3.281 \approx 9.8 \text{ feet}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			One more idea to keep in mind when converting units: a few large things equals a lot of small things. Instead of buying a lot of small bags of ice to fill your cooler, you can buy a few larger bags of ice instead. In our example, a meter is much bigger than a foot. So it makes sense that a small number of meters (3 meters) equalled a larger number of feet (9.8 feet). That might seem backwards, but that's how it works.

		<title>Converting decimal parts of quantities</title>

		<p>
			When we converted 3 meters into feet, we got 9.8 feet, which might sound like a funny answer. We're much more used to a whole number of feet and then the fraction in inches. It's 9 feet and some number of inches. To figure out the inches we look at the decimal part: <me>9.8 \text{ feet} -9\text{ feet}=0.8 \text{ feet}</me>. That's the part we need to convert to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we use the (exact) conversion <me>1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}</me> to get the right unit conversion fraction: <me>0.8 \cancel{\text{ feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \cancel{\text{ foot}}} = 0.8 \times 12 = 9.6 \text{ inches} \approx 10 \text{ inches}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The board is about 9 feet and 10 inches high. The common shorthand for this answer is 9<prime/> 10<dblprime/>. (That's pronounced <em>9 foot 10</em>, as in our team's new center is <em>6 foot 7</em>.) The <prime/> symbol indicates feet and <dblprime/> indicates inches.
		</p>

		<p>
			You might have guessed that 9.8 feet would be 9 feet and 8 inches, or 9<prime /> 8<dblprime/>. I mean, that sort of looks obvious. The reason it's not is because decimal numbers are based on 10, but inches are based on 12. So, the 0.8 feet really means <m>\frac{8}{10}</m> feet, and 8 inches would mean
			<me>
				8 \text{ inches} \ast \dfrac{1 \text{ foot}}{12\text{ inches}} 
				= \dfrac{8}{12} \text{ feet}
				= 8 \div 12
				= 0.66666\ldots \text{ feet} \approx 0.7 \text{ feet}
			</me>
			We wanted 0.8 feet, so that's not it -- 8<dblprime/> is a bit too short. On the other hand, our actual answer of 10<dblprime/> worked just fine since
			<me>
				10 \text{ inches} \ast \dfrac{1 \text{ foot}}{12\text{ inches}} 
				= \dfrac{10}{12} \text{ feet}
				= 10 \div 12
				= 0.8333\ldots \text{ feet} \approx 0.8 \text{ feet}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			So, the diver jumped from a board that was about 9<prime/> 10<dblprime/> high. What was the highest height she reached?
			The highest height we had recorded for the diver was 4.48 meters. Now we know that's 
			<me>
				4.48 \cancel{\text{ meters}}  \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \cancel{\text{ meter}}} 
				=4.48 \times 3.281= 14.69888\ldots \text{ feet} 
				\approx 14.7 \text{ feet}
			</me> 
			In feet and inches, that's about 14 feet, 8 inches because 
			<me>
				0.7 \cancel{\text{ feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \cancel{\text{ foot}}} 
				= 0.7 \times 12 = 8.4 \text{ inches} 
				\approx 8 \text{ inches}
			</me> 
			The diver's highest height was around 14<prime/> 8<dblprime/>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Again, you might have guessed that 14.7 feet would be 14<prime/> 7<dblprime/>, but 7<dblprime /> works out to just under 0.6 feet (check!), not 0.7 feet.

		<subsection component="not-workbook" xml:id="ss-1-4-units-rounding">
			<title>Aside: Rounding</title>
			
			<p>
				Quick caution here. When we converted 3 meters into feet, we got 9.843 feet, which we rounded off to get 9.8 feet, and then we just used the 0.8 feet to find the extra inches. Maybe we should have used the more precise 0.843 feet instead. Here's what happens. <me>0.843 \cancel{\text{ feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \cancel{\text{ foot}}} = 0.843 \times 12 = 10.116 \text{ inches} \approx 10 \text{ inches}</me> Phew, that's the same as what we got when we rounded earlier!
			</p>

			<p>
				Similarly, when we converted 4.48 meters into feet, we got <m>14.69888\ldots</m> feet, which we rounded to 14.7 feet, and then we just used the 0.7 feet to find the extra inches. Maybe we should have used the more precise 0.69888 feet instead:
				<me>0.69888 \cancel{\text{ feet}} \ast \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{1 \cancel{\text{ foot}}} = 0.69888 \times 12 = 8.38656 \text{ inches} \approx 8 \text{ inches}</me>
				Good, that one also worked out the same. You should be careful, though, because rounding too much too early might produce a big change in your final result.

	<subsection component="not-workbook" xml:id="ss-1-4-compound-units">
		<title>Converting more complicated units</title>
		
		<p>
			Some units, like the ones we use for length or time, are pretty straightforward. Other units, like the ones we use for speed, are made up of several other units put together. We can use the same thinking to convert these more complicated units: we just have to do them one at a time.
		</p>

		<p>
			During the first 0.2 seconds of her dive, we calculated the diver's speed as 4.4 meters per second. How fast is that? We can certainly convert to feet per second, using the fact that <m>3.281 \text{ feet} \approx 1 \text{ meter}</m>:
			<me>
				\frac{4.4 \cancel{\text{ meters}}}{\text{second}} \ast \frac{3.281 \text{ feet}}{1 \cancel{\text{ meter}}} 
				= 4.4 \times 3.281 
				= \frac{14.4364 \text{ feet}}{\text{second}}
			</me> 
			Does that help us understand how fast she's going? Maybe a little. But, we're probably most familiar with speeds measured in miles per hour, because that's what <term>mph</term> stands for.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's convert 14.4364 feet per second to miles per hour. To accomplish this, we'll need to convert seconds into hours, and we'll need to convert feet into miles. It doesn't matter which order you do this, or how many steps you need to take in between. Our plan in this example is to go from seconds to minutes, and then from minutes to hours, and to go from feet to miles.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, use that <me>1 \text{ minute} = 60 \text{ seconds}</me> to get 
			<me>
				\frac{14.4364  \text{ feet}}{\cancel{\text{ second}}} \ast \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ seconds}}}{1\text{ minute}} 
				=  14.4364 \times 60 
				= \frac{866.184 \text{ feet}}{\text{minute}}
			</me> 
			The larger number makes sense here because she can go more feet in a minute than in just one second.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, use that <me>1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}</me> to get 
			<me>\frac{866.184 \text{ feet}}{\cancel{\text{ minute}}}\ast  \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}} 
				= 866.184 \times 60 
				= \frac{ 51{,}971.04\text{ feet}}{\text{hour}}
			</me> 
			Again, the larger number makes sense because she can go more feet in an hour than in just one minute.
		</p>

		<p>
			Last, we need to convert to miles. Turns out that <me>1 \text{ mile} = 5{,}280 \text{ feet}</me> and so 
			<me>
				\frac{51{,}971.04 \cancel{\text{ feet}}}{\text{hour}}
				\ast  \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5{,}280 \cancel{\text{ feet}}} 
				= 51{,}971.04 \div 5{,}280
				= \frac{9.843 \text{ miles}}{\text{hour}} 
				\approx 10 \text{ mph}.
			</me> 
			This time we got a smaller number because she can go a lot fewer miles in an hour compared to feet in an hour. Notice how we needed to divide by 5,280. Numbers on top of the fraction multiply. Those on the bottom divide.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can do this entire calculation all at once. Notice how all of the units cancel to leave us with miles per hour. 
			<me>
				\frac{4.4 \cancel{\text{ meters}}}{\cancel{\text{ second}}} 
				\ast \frac{3.281 \cancel{\text{ feet}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ meter}}}  
				\ast \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ seconds}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ minute}}}
				\ast \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}}
				\ast \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5{,}280\cancel{\text{ feet}}}
			</me> 
			<me>= 4.4 \times 3.281 \times 60 \times 60 \div 5{,}280 = 9.843 \text{ mph} \approx 10 \text{ mph}.</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Right before the diver hit the water she was going around 7.25 meters per second. How fast is that in mph? Ready for it all in one line? Here it is.
			<me>
				\frac{7.25 \cancel{\text{ meters}}}{\cancel{\text{ second}}} 
				\ast \frac{3.281 \cancel{\text{ feet}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ meter}}}  
				\ast \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ seconds}}}{1 \cancel{\text{ minute}}}
				\ast \frac{60 \cancel{\text{ minutes}}}{1\text{ hour}}
				\ast \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{5{,}280\cancel{\text{ feet}}}
			</me> 
			<me>=7.25 \times 3.281 \times 60 \times 60 \div 5{,}280 = 16.2185\ldots \approx 16 \text{ mph}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're having trouble setting up unit conversions, remember to write down the units so you can see how they cancel. If you can't remember a number for a unit conversion, like feet for one mile, try searching online.
