        <p>
            Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don't spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something.
        </p>

                Leopard print hat. Originally 5 out of 1,000 women shopping at a major retail store even looked twice. But that number grew and grew, by my estimate around 40% a week, thanks to carefully placed ads in fashion magazines.

                    The leopard print hat is considered popular when more than 300 out of 1,000 women try it on. According to the equation, <em>approximately</em> when will the hat be considered popular? Use successive approximation to find the answer to the nearest week and display your guesses in a table.

                The number of geese in the Twin Cities metropolitan area increased from 480 in 1968 to 25,000 in 1994. Although population is sometimes modeled with exponential models, there are many factors that might make an exponential model inappropriate, such as changes in migration, wetlands, and hunting.

    <exercise xml:id="strontium-90-PE5A">
        <introduction>
            <p>
                One of the toxic radioactive elements produced by nuclear power plants is strontium-90. A large amount of strontium-90 was released in the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the 1980s. The clouds carried the strontium-90 great distances. The rain washed it down into the grass, which was eaten by cows. People then drank the milk from the cows. Unfortunately, strontium-90 causes cancer. Strontium-90 is particularly dangerous because it has a half-life of approximately 28 years, which means that every 28 years half of the existing strontium-90 changes into a safe product; the other half remains strontium-90. Suppose that a person drank milk containing 100 milligrams of strontium-90.
