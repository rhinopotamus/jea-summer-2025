                    Gas mileage is usually rounded down to the nearest one decimal place. What is the gas mileage for a car measured as getting 42.812 miles per gallon? What about a car getting 23.09 miles per gallon?

                It is easiest to compare the size of decimal numbers when they are written the same precision. For example, $1.7 million is more money than $1.34 million because when we write both numbers to two decimal places we see <me>1.7 = 1.70 &gt; 1.34</me> The symbol <m>&gt;</m> means <q>greater than;</q> it points to the smaller number. Alternatively, when we expand both numbers we see <me>1,700,000  &gt; 1,340,000</me>
                In each story, write all of the decimal numbers given to the same precision and list the numbers from largest to smallest using <m>&gt;</m> signs.

                    Dawn tested a water sample from her apartment and found 21.19 ppm of sulfate. She volunteers at a local soup kitchen where the water sample tested at 21.3 ppm. (The abbreviation <term>ppm</term> stands for â€œparts per million. Not to worry - sulfate levels below 250 are considered safe for human consumption.)
