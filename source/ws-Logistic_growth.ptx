                Back in 1975 when my aunt and uncle bought their house upstate New York, there was a small pond in the yard. They enlarged it and stocked it with 10 small fish. The number of fish <m>F</m> increased over time, approximately according to the equation <me>F=\frac{1,000}{1+99 \ast 0.65^T}</me> where <m>T</m> is time measured in years since 1975.
