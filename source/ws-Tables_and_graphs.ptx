			<p>
				My grandfather had $200 in savings bonds that matured in 1962 when he gave them to me. 
				The bonds continue to earn interest at a fixed rate so I have yet to cash them in. 
				The table shows some values. <em>(Story also appears in 4.1 #3 and 5.3 #1.)</em>

				How cold is it? An air temperature of 10<m>^\circ</m>F is cold but manageable. 
				But add a 30 miles per hour wind and, brrr, it feels like it is -12<m>^\circ</m>F 
				(12 below zero). We say the <term>wind chill</term> of 10<m>^\circ</m>F 
				with a 30 mph wind is -12<m>^\circ</m>F. 
				The table lists the wind chill for various wind speeds at an air temperature of
