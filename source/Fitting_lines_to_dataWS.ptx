			Is it true that students who work part-time have lower grades? Do the number of hours matter? The table shows the grade point average (GPA) of ten students compared to the number of hours per week each student works at a part time job. The variables we used are <m>H</m>, for the time worked at job (hours/week), and <m>G</m> for the GPA, on the usual scale of 0.0 to 4.0.
