    <exercise xml:id="flu-dorm-modeling-exponential" workspace="1.2in">
        <introduction>
            <p>
                A flu virus has been spreading through the college dormitories. Initially 8 students were diagnosed with the flu, but that number has been growing 16% per day. Earlier we found the equation <me>N=8 \ast1.16^T</me> where <m>T</m> is the time in days (since the first diagnosis) and <m>N</m> is the total number of students who had the flu. <em>(Story also appears in 2.2 #3 and 5.5 textbook)</em>

            <statement>
                <p>
                    Use successive approximations to <em>estimate</em> when the number of infected students reaches 100. Display your guesses in a table.

                    There are 1,094 students currently living in the dorms. Suppose ultimately 250 students catch the flu. According to your equation, when would that happen? Show how to solve your equation.

                <p>
                    It is not realistic to expect that everyone living in the dorms will catch the flu, but what does the equation say? Set up and solve an equation to find when all 1,094 students would have the flu. (Again, this is not realistic.)

        <introduction>
            <p>
                Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations are related to global climate change. In 1980, the carbon dioxide concentration was 338 ppm (parts per million). At that time it was assumed that carbon dioxide concentrations would increase 0.42% per year.<aside>Source: Earth Systems Research Laboratory, NOAA</aside>

                    Assuming the growth is exponential as predicted, write an equation that describes the increase in carbon dioxide concentrations.

                    The carbon dioxide concentration in 2008 was 385 ppm. Is that count higher or lower than predicted from your equation? Explain.

                    Does that mean that carbon dioxide increased at a higher or lower rate than 0.42%? Explain.
