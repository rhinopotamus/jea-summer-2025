	<introduction>
		<p>
			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don't spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don't forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				United States ethanol production has been growing exponentially. In 1990, there were 0.9 billion gallons of ethanol produced. At that time it was estimated that production would increase 5.5% per year.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				An insurance <term>deductible</term> is the amount you pay for any claim before the insurance company starts paying. Lee's automobile insurance deductible started at $500, but they take off $10 for each month where he has no accidents or tickets. For example, after 1 month his deductible was $490, after 2 months it was $480, and so on.
