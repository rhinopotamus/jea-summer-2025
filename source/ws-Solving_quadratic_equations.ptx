				The art museum opened in 1920. After an initial rush to see the great holdings, attendance dropped for awhile. But then attendance began to rise again and has risen since. The number of annual visits <m>N</m> is approximated by the equation <me>N= 51T^2-840T+3,700</me> where <m>T</m> is time measured in years since 1920.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10'<m>\times</m>25' vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.
			</p>
			<image source='GravelPath.png'/>
			<p>
				The amount of gravel we need (<m>G</m> cubic feet) is given by the equation <me>G = W^2 + 17.5W</me> where <m>W</m> is the width of the path in feet. For example, a path 4 feet wide requires 86 cubic feet of gravel, as you can check. <em>(Story also appears in 2.3 and 2.4 Exercises)</em>
