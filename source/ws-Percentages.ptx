        <p>
            On each problem, write down what you enter into your calculator and don't forget to write the units on your final answer. You are welcome to calculate the answer step-by-step but also challenge yourself to figure out the answer all at once, not hitting = on your calculator until the very end.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                As I write this problem, the population of the world is 8,056,959,718 people (just over 8 billion). It changes by the second, so let's use the round figure of 8,100,000,000.

                <p>
                    I read that the population of Brazil accounts for 2.69% of the world's population. According to that report, what is the population of Brazil? Round your answer to the nearest million.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                In Minneapolis, apartment rent is expected to increase by 16% next year.

                    Astra lives in a 1-bedroom apartment where they pay $825 per month in rent. If their rent increased by 16% what would their new rent be?

                    Lucky for Astra, their building is subject to rent stabilization laws and so their rent cannot increase by more than 3%. What would their new rent be?

        <introduction>
            <p>
                The intersection by my house is dangerous. One year there were 14 accidents there. The neighbors got together and petitioned to have 4-way stop signs installed.

                <p>
                    The city estimated that the installed stop signs would reduce accidents at least 40%. If that happens, how many accidents would we expect the next year?

                    The national average shows that the new signs could reduce accidents up to 62%. If that happens instead, how many accidents would we expect the next year?
