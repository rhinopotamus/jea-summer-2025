			A truck hauling bags of grass seed weighs pounds when it is empty. Each bag of seed it carries weighs 4.2 pounds. The equation for the gross weight <m>W</m> pounds is <me>W = \text{3,900} + 4.2B</me> for <m>B</m> bags of grass seed. <em>Story also appears in 2.1 #1 &amp; 3.2 #1</em>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Set up and solve an equation to determine the number of bags of grass seed being carried by the truck with gross weight of 14,500 pounds.

			Is laughter really the best medicine? A study examined the impact of comedy on anxiety levels. Subjects’ anxiety levels were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 before and after the study. Levels averaged 4.3 before the study. There was no significant change in subjects in the control group. Subjects who watched the comedy videos showed a noticeable difference, and it depended on the hours of comedy watched. Anxiety levels fell an average of .098 (on the 1 to 5 scale) for each hour of comedy watched.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing average anxiety levels for subjects who watched comedy videos for 0 hours (control group), 2 hours, 10 hours, and 20 hours, according to these findings.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Use successive approximation to guess the number of hours watching comedy needed to lower the average anxiety level below 2 (on that scale of 1 to 5).
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables and write an equation relating them. Anxiety is measured on a unitless scale.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Solve your equation to determine the number of hours watching comedy needed to lower the average anxiety level below 2.

			Lizbeth wants to send her mom truffles for Mother’s Day. It cost $<m>C</m> to send a box of <m>T</m> truffles where <me>C = 1.90T+7.95</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>

			The local burger restaurant had a promotion this summer. They reduced the price on a bacon double cheeseburger by 2 for each degree in the daily high temperature. The equation is <me>B = 7.16 -.02H</me> where $<m>B</m> is the price of the bacon double cheeseburger and <m>H</m> is the daily high temperature, in <m>^\circ</m>F. <em>Story also appears in 2.1 Exercises</em>
