				It is easiest to compare the size of decimal numbers when they are written the same precision. For example, $1.7 million is more money than $1.34 million because when we write both numbers to two decimal places we see <me>1.7 = 1.70 &gt; 1.34</me> The symbol <m>&gt;</m> means <q>greater than;</q> it points to the smaller number. Alternatively, when we expand both numbers we see <me>\text{1,700,000}  &gt; \text{1,340,000}</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				In each story, write all of the decimal numbers given to the same precision and list the numbers from largest to smallest using <m>&gt;</m> signs.
