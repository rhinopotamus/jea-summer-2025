\section{Modeling with linear equations}

A family with one full-time worker earning minimum wage cannot afford the local fair-market rent for a two-bedroom apartment anywhere in the United States.  
Even families earning above minimum can struggle to rent an apartment for less than 30\% of their income.  As a result, many people need affordable housing.  There are various local, state, and federally funded programs as well as non-profit agencies working to increase availability.

In our city there are about \text{64,100} apartments considered affordable.  So the city partnered with local developers to build \text{7,800} more apartments each year.    Our variables are
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {l} 
$A=$ affordable housing (apartments) $\sim$ dep \\
$Y=$ time (years from now) $\sim$ indep \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Assuming things proceed as planned, after 5 years there would be 
$$\text{64,100 apts } + 5 \text{ years} \ast \frac{\text{7,800 apts}}{\text{year}}=\text{64,100}+\underline{5} \times \text{7,800} =  \text{103,100} \text{ apartments}$$
Generalizing, we get our equation $$\text{64,100}+Y\ast \text{7,800} =  A$$
which can be rewritten as $$A = \text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y$$
This equation fits our template for a linear equation 
$$\text{dep }=\text{ start } + \text{slope} \ast {\text{indep}}$$

Quick recap.  A function is \textbf{linear} if its graph is a line, and \textbf{nonlinear} otherwise.  The rate of change measures the steepness of the graph for any function, but a line is the same steepness everywhere, so the rate of change, or \textbf{slope} of a line is constant.   Our example is linear because the slope of \text{7,800} apartments per year is constant.  Our starting or fixed amount is the \textbf{intercept}.  In our example it's  \text{64,100} apartments.  The dependent variable and the intercept always have the same units -- apartments in our example.  But $$\text{units for slope} =\frac{\text{units for dep}}{\text{units for indep}}$$ so, in our example slope is measured in apartments \emph{per year}.
These units can help you identify the slope and intercept in a story -- so keep a look out.

How many years will it take the city to reach \text{150,000} apartments at this rate?  After ten years, for example, there would still not be enough affordable apartments because $$A = \text{64,100}+\text{7,800} \ast 10 = \text{64,100}+  \text{7,800}\times \underline{10}=  \text{142,100} \text{ apartments}$$
Continuing successive approximation we get
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {|c| |c |c |c |c |c|}\hline
$Y$ & 0 & 5 & 10 & 11 & 12\\ \hline
$A$ & \text{64,100} & \text{103,100} & \text{142,100} & \text{149,900} & \text{157,700} \\ \hline
vs.\ \text{150,000}& low & low & low & low& high\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
This city will reach \text{150,000} affordable apartments within 12 years.

Of course, we could solve a linear equation instead.  We want $A=\text{150,000}$.  
Using our equation $A=\text{64,100} + \text{7,800} Y$ we get
$$ \text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y = \text{150,000}$$
However, since we want \emph{at least} \text{150,000} affordable apartments, an inequality is even better.  Let's practice that.
 $$ \text{64,100} + \text{7,800}Y \ge \text{150,000}$$
 Subtract \text{64,100} from each side to get
  \begin{eqnarray*}
\cancel{\text{64,100}} + \text{7,800}Y & \ge &\text{150,000}  \\
-\cancel{\text{64,100}} \hspace{.6 in} & & -\text{64,100}  \\ % SU awkward to use hspace!
\end{eqnarray*}
\vspace{-.5in} %VSPACE

\noindent which simplifies to $$ \text{7,800}Y\ge \text{85,900}$$
Divide each side by \text{7,800} to get
$$\frac{\cancel{\text{7,800}}~Y}{\cancel{\text{7,800}}} \ge \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}}$$
which simplifies to $$Y \ge   \frac{\text{85,900}}{\text{7,800}} = \text{85,900} \div \text{7,800} = 11.0128205...$$
To be sure $Y \ge 11.0128205...$ we need to round up to get $$Y \ge 12$$

Let's confirm our findings on the graph.
\begin{center}
\scalebox {.8} {\includegraphics [width = 6in] {apartments.png}}
\end{center}
As expected, the graph is a line.  And we see that the city should reach its goal of \text{150,000} affordable apartments in 12 years, or slightly before then.
