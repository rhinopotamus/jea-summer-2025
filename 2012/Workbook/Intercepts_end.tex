\noindent \textbf{Do you know \ldots} % Intercepts

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
\item What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph? 
\item How to calculate the intercept given the slope and an example (another point on the graph)? 
\item Why an intercept might not make sense, for example if it's outside the domain of the function? 
\item When a linear function is a direct proportion? 
\item Why you cannot reason proportionally if the linear function is not a direct proportion? 
\item What the graph of a direct proportion looks like? 
\end{enumerate}
