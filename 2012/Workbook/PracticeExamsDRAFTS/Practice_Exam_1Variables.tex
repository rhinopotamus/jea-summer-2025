Relax.  You have done problems like these before.  Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can.  If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator.  Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can.  Don't spend too much time on any one problem.  Do well.  And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something.

\item Ndwiga is reading an article in the paper about atoms.  From his physics textbook he discovered that the size of an atom is .142 nanometers.  (That's 0.142 nanometers.)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the size of an atom in meters.  Use $1 \text{ meter} = \text{1,000,000,000 nanometers}$.   Write your answer in usual decimal notation and in scientific notation. \vfill \vfill
\item Ndwiga would like to know how many atoms across this sheet of paper which is 8.5 inches wide. Use that $1 \text{ inch} \approx 2.54 \text{ cm}$ and $1 \text{ meter} = 100 \text{ cm}$.  Express your final answer in billions of atoms. \vfill \vfill \vfill
