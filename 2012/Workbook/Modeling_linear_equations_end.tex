\noindent \textbf{Do you know \ldots} % Modeling linear equations

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
\item What makes a function linear? 
\item What the slope of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph? 
\item What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph? 
\item The template for a linear equation?  \emph{Ask your instructor if you need to remember the template or if it will be provided during the exam.}
\item How to write a linear equation given the starting amount (intercept) and the rate of change (slope)?   
\item Where the slope and intercept appear in the template of a linear equation? 
\item What the graph of a linear function looks like? 
\item How to solve a linear equation?  
\item Why the rate of change of a linear function is constant?  
\end{enumerate}
