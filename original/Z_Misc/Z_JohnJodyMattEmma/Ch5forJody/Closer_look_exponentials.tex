We have seen how exponential equations help us understand a variety of situations -- from investments and loans, to rising health care costs, to population growth, or any quantity increasing at a fixed percentage.  But that's not all.  In this chapter we explore other situations in which exponential equations help us understand any type of exponential growth (increasing) as well as exponential decay (decreasing).  

We have encountered exponential equations often in this text already, so this chapter begins with a review section on everything we have seen:  modeling with exponential equations; interpreting exponential growth, especially the growth factor and percent increase; graphing exponential equations; solving exponential equations using logs; and the connection between percent increase and exponential growth in the first place.

Next, we study exponential growth in more detail as well as exponential decay, including finding the growth factor when we are not told the percent change.  After that we compare how linear or exponential equations model situations where it's not clear which to use (if either).  We close with a section on comparing exponential growth, which grows without bound, to saturation and logistic models, which start off similar to exponential growth but then level off.
