\item Relax.  You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. 
\item  If you're not sure of something or if you're stuck, please ask! 
\item You may use your calculator but please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can.  
\item Some formulas from our book that you might need are on a separate sheet.
\item Don't spend too much time on any one problem.
\item  Do well.  And remember to ask me if you need help.

\item My plumber charges $P$ dollars for $H$ hours of work, as given by the following formula:
$$P = 24.95 + 85.00H$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a table of values showing the charges for 1 hour, 1$\frac{1}{2}$ hours, 2 hours, and 3 hours.

\item If the bill for my plumber's last visit was $\$218.75$, how much time did she work?

\emph{Set up and solve an equation to answer the question.  If you can't solve it, then you may estimate the answer to two decimal places for possible partial credit.}

\item The timing of the sunset depends on the latitude (how far North of South of the equator one is) and the time of year.  In Minneapolis, the sunset occurred at 6:01 PM on March 1.  The time of the sunset is expected to occur 1.26 minutes later each day.  In Galveston, Texas, the sunset occurred at 6:19 PM on March 1 and is expected to occur 0.58 minutes later each day.  (Note: do not worry about Daylight Savings Time.) If we let $S$ represent the time of the sunset (in minutes since 6 PM) for $D$ days after March 1, then the equations are:

\vspace{.1in}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {ll} 
Minneapolis: &$S=1+1.26D$ \\
Galveston: & $S=19+0.58D$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The table shows sunset times for the two cities:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {|l|r|r|r|r|} \hline
$D$ & 0 & 5 & 15 & 31 \\ \hline
$S$ (Minneapolis) & 1 &  7.3 & 19.9 & 40.1  \\ \hline
$S$ (Galveston) & 19 & 21.9 & 27.7 & 37.0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Which city has a later sunset on March 10 (i.e. after 10 days)?  \emph{Justify your answer.}
\vfill

\item Draw a graph illustrating both equations.

\item Set up and solve an equation to find when the two cities will have the sunset at the same time. Report your answer to the nearest day.

\item Joy jumped from a rock into an abandoned mining pit filled with water. The rock ledge was 10 meters above the ground.  Her height above the water, $H$ meters, after $T$ seconds is given by the formula: $$H = 10 + 3.2T - 4.88T^2$$

\item A summit in Copenhagen, Denmark in late 2009 focused on climate change and its impacts.  Increasing carbon dioxide emissions are a cause of concern because of their linkages to climate change.  In 1959 (when modern instruments could first measure carbon dioxide concentrations), the average concentration in the Northern Hemisphere was 316 parts per million (ppm) CO$_{2}$.  That is to say, there were 316 CO$_{2}$ molecules for every million molecules of air.  In 2008, the concentration of CO$_{2}$ was 386 ppm CO$_{2}$.  Assuming this increase is exponential, from 1959 to 2008 the CO$_{2}$ concentration grew at a rate of 0.41\% per year.  That is, the CO$_{2}$ concentration $C$ (in ppm) $Y$ years after 1959 is given by the equation:

$$C=316(1.0041)^Y$$

\begin{enumerate}
\item According to this equation, what will the CO$_{2}$ concentration be in 2010?
\vfill
\item If the value continues to increase, in what year will the CO$_{2}$ concentration be over 400 parts per million CO$_{2}$?

\emph{Set up and solve an equation to answer the question.  If you can't solve it, then you may estimate the answer for possible partial credit.}

\item I was boiling water on the stove for some tea.  When I took it off the stove it was boiling at a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit. The tea was cool enough to drink at a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit 20 minutes later. You can assume that the coffee cools exponentially.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Name the variables, including units.
\vfill
\item Write an equation describing the temperature of the tea as it cools.
\vfill
\item By what percentage does the tea temperature decrease each minute?
\vfill
\item What will the tea temperature be 10 minutes later (i.e.\ after 30 minutes total)?
