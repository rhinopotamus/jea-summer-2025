 \noindent \textsc{Percent Change Formula:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item   If a quantity changes by a percentage corresponding to growth rate $r$, then the growth factor is $$\displaystyle g=1+r$$
\item If the growth factor is $g$, then the growth rate is $$r = g-1$$ ~
\end{itemize}
 
\noindent \textsc{Growth Factor Formula:} \bigskip

If a quantity is growing (decaying) exponentially, then the growth (decay) factor is 
$$\displaystyle g = \sqrt[t]{\frac{a}{s}}$$ 
\quad where $s$ is the starting amount and $a$ is the amount after $t$ time periods.

\item In 1962, my grandfather had savings bonds that matured  to \$200.  He gave those to my mother to keep for me.  These bonds have continued to earn interest at a fixed, guaranteed rate so I have yet to cash them in.  The table lists the value at various times since then.  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {|c|| c| c| c| c| c| c|} \hline
year & 1962 & 1970 & 1980 & 1990 & 2000 & 2010\\ \hline
$Y$ & 0 & 8 & 18 & 28 & 38 & 48\\ \hline
$B$ & 200.00 & 318.77 & 570.87 & 1,022.34 & 1,830.85 & 3,278.77 \\ \hline

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the \textsc{Growth Factor Formula} to find the annual growth factor for the time period from 1962 to 1970.  \vfill
\item Repeat for 1970 to 1980.    \vfill
\item What do you notice?  What in the story told you that would happen?  \vfill
\item What is the corresponding interest rate?   \vfill
\item Write an equation for the value of bonds over time.  \vfill
\item Use your equation to check the information for 1990, 2000, and 2010.  \vfill

\item In what year will the bond be worth over \$5,000?  Set up and solve an equation to decide.  \vfill  \vfill
\item Draw a graph using the data in the table, but not your answer to part (g).  Include another year that is later than your answer to part (g).

\item Does your answer to part (g) agree with your graph?  If not, fix your work.

\item Have you read news stories about archaeological digs where a specimen (like a bone) is found that dates back thousands of years?  How do scientists know how old something is?  One method uses the radioactive decay of carbon.  After an animal dies the carbon-14 in its body very slowly decays.  By comparing how much carbon-14 remains in the bone to how much carbon-14 should have been in the bone when the animal was alive, scientist can estimate how long the animal has been dead.  Clever, huh?  Actually, it is so clever that Willard Libby won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for it.  The key information to know is that the half-life of carbon-14 is about 5,730 years. For this problem, suppose a bone were found that should have contained 300 milligrams of carbon-14 when the animal was alive.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the annual ``growth'' factor. Keep as many digits as possible for your calculations.  \vfill
\item Name the variables and write an equation describing the dependence. \vfill
\item How many milligrams of carbon-14 should remain in this bone after 1,000 years? After 10,000 years? After 100,000 years?  \vfill
\item How many milligrams of carbon-14 should remain in this bone after 1 million years?  Explain the answer your calculator gives you.  \vfill

\item Draw a graph that shows up to 10,000 years.

\item If the bone is determined to have 100 milligrams of carbon-14, how old is it? That is, approximately how long ago did it die? Start by estimating the answer from your graph.  Then revise your estimate using successive approximation.  Display your guesses in a table. \vfill
\item Solve the equation exactly. \vfill \vfill

\item For each story, find the annual growth factor $g$ and annual growth rate $r$ as a percent.  

\emph{Hint:  First decide if you can use the \textsc{Percent Change Formula} or if you will need to use the \textsc{Growth Factor Formula}.}

\emph{Don't forget to include the negative sign for decay rates.}
