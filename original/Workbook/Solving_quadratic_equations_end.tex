\noindent \textbf{Do you know \ldots} %Solving quadratic equations

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
\item What a ``quadratic'' function is? 
\item How to solve a quadratic equation? 
\item When we use the \textsc{Quadratic Formula}?   \emph{Ask your instructor if you need to remember the \textsc{Quadratic Formula} or if it will be provided during the exam.}
\item How to solve a quadratic equation when the function is not set equal to zero? 
\item How to identify the values of $a, b, c$ in the formula? 
\item How to evaluate the formula (using your calculator)?   \item Why there are (usually) two solutions to a quadratic equation? 
\item How to decide which solution(s) from the \textsc{Quadratic Formula} are correct? 
\item What the graph of a quadratic function looks like? 
\item The value for the independent variable to find  the highest (or lowest) value of a quadratic function? 
\end{enumerate}
