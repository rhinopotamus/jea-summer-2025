\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
\item What a scatter plot is? 
\item Why we might begin the scale for a scatter plot somewhere other than 0?
\item Why we would approximate data with a linear function? 
\item How to decide visually whether a line is a reasonable approximation of the data? 
\item The name for a point that falls very far away from an approximating line? 
\item How to graph a line from its equation by creating a table first.
\item Why even the best fitting line doesn't go through most of the data points?
\end{enumerate}
