\noindent \textbf{Do you know \ldots} % Units

\begin{enumerate} [(a)]
\item How to convert from one unit of measurement to another?   
\item What a unit conversion fraction is?   
\item Why multiplying by a unit conversion fraction doesn't change the amount, just the units?   
\item How to connect repeated conversions into one calculation?   
\item Why if we convert an amount to a larger unit, we use a smaller number?  
\item How many seconds in a minute, minutes in an hour, hours in a day, days in a year, inches in a foot, feet in a mile, and other common conversions? 

\emph{Ask your instructor which common conversions you need to remember, and whether any conversion formulas will be provided during the exam.}   
\item How to convert between English and metric measurements? 

\emph{Again, ask your instructor which metric conversions you need to remember, and whether any conversion formulas will be provided during the exam.}
