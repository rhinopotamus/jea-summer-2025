Relax.  You have done problems like these before.  Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can.  If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator.  Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can.  Don't spend too much time on any one problem.  Do well.  And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something. \bigskip

\noindent \emph{As you work, make a ``don't forget'' list of any information you need to look up or ask about.}

\begin{enumerate} 

\item Forde collects miniature cars, each weighing 1.76 ounces.  His car box weighs 4 ounces when empty.  The total weight $T$ ounces of Forde's car box depends on the number of cars $C$ according to the equation $$T=4+1.76C$$
%Forrest's candy bucket weighs 4 ounces when empty.  Each Snickers Almond\footnote{For those who can remember, Snickers Almond is essentially the old Mars Bar renamed.  But, I digress.} bar he puts in his bucket weighs 1.76 ounces.   The total weight $T$ ounces of Forrest's candy bucket depends on the number of Snickers Almond bars $B$ according to the equation $$T=4+1.76B$$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a table of values showing the weight if it contains 1, 5, 12, or 20 cars.
\vfill
\item Draw a graph illustrating the dependence.

\item How many cars can Forde fit in the box and stay under 3 pounds (that is 48 ounces)? 
Figure out the answer and mark the corresponding point on your graph.

\item  Will women ever run the marathon as fast as men do?  The world records are getting close.  In 2012 the men's record was 2:03:38 and the women's record was 2:15:25, about 12 minutes apart!  On the other hand, the record is changing very slowly.  Estimates for the men's time shows about 13 seconds drop per year on average.  Estimates for the women's time shows about 26 seconds drop per year on average.

\hfill \begin{footnotesize} Source:  Wikipedia (Marathon World Record Progression) \end{footnotesize}
%Data from wikipedia shows Men's record 2003 = 2:04:55, then 2007 = 2:04:26, then 2008=2:03:59, and then 2011=2:03:38.  For the women it's 199 = 2:20:43, then 2001 = 2:19:46, then 2002 = 2:17:18, and then 2003 = 2:15:25.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Write an equation for each function:  men's and women's.  Use $T$ for the marathon times (in seconds) and $Y$ for the years (measured in years since 2012).  Note that 2:03:38 $= \text{7,418} $ seconds and 2:12:25 $= \text{7,945}$ seconds. 
\vfill
\item Use successive approximate to estimate when the women's record might equal the men's record.  Display your guesses in a table.
\vfill
\item Set up and solve a system to estimate when the women's record might equal the men's record.

\item An online music club charges a monthly enrollment fee plus \$.95 per album you download.  Last month Andrew downloaded 31 albums for a total cost of \$49.00.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the monthly enrollment fee?  
\vfill
\item Name the variables, including units, and write an equation relating them. 
\vfill
\item If the bill next month is for \$87.95, how many albums did Andrew download? Show how to solve the equation

\item A report  shows September sea-ice declining in the Northern hemisphere. In 1980 the extent of the sea-ice was 3.1 million square miles.  By 2012, the sea-ice extended only 1.7 million square miles.  For this problem, suppose that the area of sea-ice decreases linearly. 
\hfill \begin{footnotesize} Source: National Snow and Ice Data Center \end{footnotesize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Name the variables, including units. 
\vfill
\item What is the rate of sea ice decrease? 
\vfill
\item Write a linear equation relating your variables. 
\vfill
\item Scientists are concerned that if the September sea-ice falls between \text{200,000} and \text{500,000} square miles, then other climate feedbacks will lead to no more sea-ice in September.  According to your equation, in what year is this expected to occur?  Set up and solve an inequality to answer the question.

\item  As people age they experience some hearing loss.  A study was done to determine the \textbf{comfort level of sound} for people of different ages, meaning the loudest sound (in decibels) that the person could listen to comfortably.  The data are given in the table.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular} {|l ||c |c |c |c |c |c |c |c |} \hline
Name & Akbar & Javier & Walter & Xang & Rolf & Derrick & Iago &Raheem \\ \hline
Age & 45 & 45 & 55 & 65 & 75 & 75 & 85 & 85\\ \hline
Comfort level & 58 & 61 & 63 & 71 & 75 & 80 & 82 & 79 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make a scatterplot showing the data.  Scale your axes to start at 40 years and start the level at 55 decibels.  Spread out your scale to get a large, detailed graph.
\bigskip
\begin{center}
\scalebox {.8} {\includegraphics [width = 6in] {GraphPaper.jpg}}
\end{center} 
\bigskip
\item  Draw the line through the points listed for Xang and Rolf.  Explain why that line does not fit the data well.  \emph{Label this line B.} 
\vfill
\item  The ``best-fitting line'' from statistics has equation $$C=34.315+.5556A$$ where $A$ is the person's age (in years) and $C$ is the comfort level (in decibels).  Make a table showing the values of $C$ when $A = 40, 60,$ and $80$.  Use those points to add this ``best-fitting line'' to your graph.
