\item Where the growth factor and starting amount appear in the template of an exponential equation?  
\item What the graph of an exponential function looks like?  
\item How to solve an exponential equation using the \textsc{Log Divides Formula}?   

\emph{Ask your instructor if you need to remember the \textsc{Log Divides Formula} or if it will be provided during the exam.}  
\item How to calculate the rate of change of an exponential function?
