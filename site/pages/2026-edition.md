The 2026 edition is an overhaul of the 2024 PreTeXt source, with a laundry list of improvements.

#### Activities 

Perhaps the single most replicated finding in all of educational research is that *students learn when they do things*, rather than by passively listening to or reading information. The chief contribution of this edition, the new Activities in Sections 1-4 of Chapters 1-5, engage students in the work of the classroom.

- Each section begins with an **Opening Activity** suitable for pre-class homework or in-class warmup. These Opening Activities remind students of something important from a previous section, introduce a key new idea, or reactivate dormant knowledge from 
- In parallel with the running example in each section, **inline Activities** gently lead students through (usually) Exercise 1 in the workbook. These Activities are suitable for in-class work individually or in small groups.

#### Workbook improvements

The workbook accompanying the main text is a key part of *JEA*'s approach. Designed to be printed and written on, it contains Exercises 1-4 from each section, rendered with writing space for each task, graph paper, and formula references. The 2026 edition improves the workbook in several ways:

- A common task across most of the problems in this book is to **name the variables**. For each of the related quantities in a story, students identify a letter name, write a description in everyday words, identify the units, and decide on dependence. We've now included a **scaffolding table** to help students remember all the parts of the name-the-variables task.
- Another common pattern of thought in this text is **successive approximation** (or "fancy guess and check," as one of my students called it). Through repeatedly evaluating a function and comparing the result to a desired value, we can produce approximate solutions to equations even without knowing the algebraic methods for exact solutions. We've now included a **scaffolding table** for successive approximation tasks to help students remember what we mean.
    
- By borrowing some space from the top and bottom margins, we've included even more writing space on each page.

#### Ease-of-use and accessibility

- Each section is now broken into several **subsections**; PreTeXt automatically generates links to each subsection for easier navigation and direction.
- Most diagrams are now rendered in [**PreFigure**](https://prefigure.org/), a free and open-source system for creating diagrams that are accessible to screen readers and can be easily rendered in a tactile format.

#### Coming soon

As I teach from this book in the Spring 2026 semester, I'll be generating more useful resources, including typeset solutions to each Activity and Exercise. Please [be in touch](mailto:sbagley@westminsteru.edu) if you have any requests!
