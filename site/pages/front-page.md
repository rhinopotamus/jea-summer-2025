### About *Just Enough Algebra*

In 1994, Dr. Suzanne Dorée and colleagues at Augsburg College had a vision for a new course to replace our intermediate algebra course. We wanted a college level course that would serve primarily as preparation for quantitative courses across the curriculum. The framing question that led to our curricular adventure of the past three decades was

> What algebra do college students need to know, and how can we make it relevant to their future studies, their lives as citizens, and their everyday life?

From these questions *Just Enough Algebra* was born.

As you will see, everything we do is in some applied context. Our choices to focus primarily on linear and exponential models; to emphasize verbal, numerical, and graphical interpretation of functions; to develop students' quantitative reasoning; and to include only the most essential symbolic techniques align well with curricular guides from the [MAA](https://maa.org/resource/cupm-guide/) and [AMATYC](https://www.amatyc.org/publications/amatyc-standards/beyond-crossroads/). 

More importantly, it works. Student learn a lot in this course. They are ready for what comes next. And, they enjoy it.
