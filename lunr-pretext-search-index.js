  "body": " Rashad measured his heart rate several times after football practice. Right after practice his heart rate was 178 beats per minute. Two minutes later, it had dropped to 153 beats per minute, and by ten minutes after practice it was down to 120 beats per minute.   Make a table showing Rashad's heart rate at each time.   Identify the variables, including units and dependence.   How quickly was Rashad's heart rate dropping during the first two minutes following practice? Hint: the units are beats per minute per minute.    How quickly was his heart rate dropping during the next time period?   Rashad does not like hitting the showers until his heart rate is close to normal, or at least below 100. He usually waits 15 minutes after practice. Do you think that's long enough? Explain.   During the time in this table, did Rashad's heart rate increase, decrease, or neither?  "

  "body": " Practice Exam 1B   Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you're not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don't spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you're not sure about something.  Try taking this version of the practice exam under testing conditions: no book, no notes, no classmate's help, no electronics (computer, cell phone, television). Give yourself one hour to work and wait until you have tried your best on all of the problems before checking any answers.   As you work, make a don't forget list of any information you need to look up or ask about.     The amount of money spent on nursing home care for seniors has continued to rise. The table shows the values for select years.

According to the table, what was the spending in 1985?   Calculate the rate of change of spending over the period 1970 to 1985. Don't forget to state the units.   In approximately what year did spending first pass $50 billion?    Trish is filling a swimming pool with water. The graph below shows how many gallons of water ( ) are in the pool after hours. Use the graph to answer the following questions.    How much water was in the swimming pool already when Trish began?   How much water was in the swimming pool after 3 hours?   After how many hours were there 1,000 gallons of water in the swimming pool?   Was Trish filling the pool faster at 2 hours or at 2.5 hours? Explain how you see that on the graph.   After (about) how many hours did Trish stop filling the swimming pool? Explain how you see that on the graph.    In 1990 the Lefèvre's property tax was $450, but it doubled every year thereafter.
