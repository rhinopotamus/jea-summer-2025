Rewrite the GDP in dollars, both in normal decimal notation and in scientific notation.   Calculate the GDP per capita (meaning per person) by dividing the GDP in dollars by the population in people.

The standard format for scientific notation?    What kinds of numbers have a positive order of magnitude, and which have a negative order of magnitude?    How to convert between decimal notation and scientific notation?    How your calculator reports numbers in scientific notation, and what (might be) different when you're reporting that number?    The usual order of operations (PEMDAS) and how to use parentheses when you want a different order?     Don't forget!    "

Source: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Census Bureau    Writing the population as 0.313 billion seems strange. A more natural unit would be millions. Rewrite the population in millions of people.   Rewrite the population in people, both in normal decimal notation (that means with all the 0s) and in scientific notation.   It also seems strange to write the GDP as $15,596 billion. A more natural unit would be trillions , where 1 trillion = 1,000,000,000,000. Rewrite the GDP in trillions of dollars.   Rewrite the GDP in dollars, both in normal decimal notation and in scientific notation.   Calculate the GDP per capita (meaning per person) by dividing the GDP in dollars by the population in people. Express your answer in $\/person.   For practice, repeat your calculation using the numbers in scientific notation.

What is the equivalent APR on Kiran's money market account? Use the Equivalent APR Formula .   Kiran puts $400 a month in her retirement account that amazingly also earns 7% interest compounded monthly. Use the Future Value Annuity Formula to determine how much Kiran will have in her retirement account in 28 years.   Kiran would really like to buy a new hybrid car that sells for $.

  "body": " Is laughter really the best medicine? A study examined the impact of comedy on anxiety levels. Subjects' anxiety levels were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 before and after the study. Levels averaged 4.3 before the study. There was no significant change in subjects in the control group. Subjects who watched the comedy videos showed a noticeable difference, and it depended on the hours of comedy watched. Anxiety levels fell an average of 0.098 (on the 1 to 5 scale) for each hour of comedy watched.   Name the variables. Anxiety is measured on a unitless scale.   Make a table showing average anxiety levels for subjects who watched comedy videos for 0 hours (control group), 2 hours, 10 hours, and 20 hours, according to these findings.   Use successive approximation to guess the approximate number of hours watching comedy needed to lower the average anxiety level below 2 (on that scale of 1 to 5).   Write an equation relating the variables.   Solve your equation to determine the exact number of hours watching comedy needed to lower the average anxiety level below 2.  "

Draw a graph illustrating the function.    Chlorine concentrations below 1.5 ppm do not disinfect properly so more chlorine needs to be added. According to your graph, approximately when will that happen?   The problem continues ...    Use successive approximation to find approximately when the concentration falls below 1.5 ppm.   Solve the equation to find exactly when the chlorine concentration falls below 1.5 ppm.   Solve the equation to find when the chlorine concentration would fall below 0.1 ppm (essentially no chlorine) assuming no chlorine was added earlier. Show how to solve the equation to find the answer (and check it!).   Report your answer to the nearest day.  "

It was really cold at 8:30 this morning when Raina arrived at the office. Luckily the heating system warms things up very quickly, 4°F per hour. By 11:00 a.m. it was a very comfortable 72°F.   Figure out what the temperature was at 8:30 a.m.   Write an equation illustrating the function.   While 72°F is a perfectly good temperature for an office, not so for ballroom dancing. When Raina arrived for her practice at 5:30 that evening, she began to sweat before she even took the floor. Turns out the air conditioner had been running since 4:00 p.m. but it only cools down the room 3°F per hour.   Figure out what the temperature was at 4:00 p.m.   Write an equation illustrating the function.    Maryn is very happy. Her interior design business is finally showing a profit. She has logged a total of 471 billable hours at $35 per hour since she started her business. Accounting for start up costs, her net profit now totals $2,194.   Name the variables, including units and dependence.   What were Maryn's start up costs?   Identify the slope and intercept (including their units and sign) and explain what each means in terms of the story.   The intercept should probably be negative, and it's not 2,194.    Calculate what Maryn's profits will be once she has logged a total of 1,000 hours.   Write an equation relating the variables.   Graph the function.     For each story, find the initial weight of the person and use it to write an equation showing how the person's weight pounds depends on the time, weeks.

Now 30 weeks pregnant and 168 pounds, she wonders if she will ever see her feet again.    Each story describes a situation that we are assuming is linear. Decide whether it is proportional , meaning the intercept equals zero. If it is proportional, explain why the intercept would be zero. If it is not proportional, explain what the intercept would mean in the story.   The price of kiwis (a kind of fruit) depends on how many kiwis you buy.   The price of a bag of tortillas depends on how many tortillas are in the bag.   The time it takes to vacuum a rug depends on the area of the rug.

What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph?    How to calculate the intercept given the slope and an example (another point on the graph)?    Why an intercept might not make sense, for example if it's outside the domain of the function?    When a linear function is a direct proportion?

Luckily the heating system warms things up very quickly, 4°F per hour. By 11:00 a.m. it was a very comfortable 72°F.   Figure out what the temperature was at 8:30 a.m.   Write an equation illustrating the function.   While 72°F is a perfectly good temperature for an office, not so for ballroom dancing.

One method uses the radioactive decay of carbon. After an animal dies the carbon-14 in its body very slowly decays. By comparing how much carbon-14 remains in the bone to how much carbon-14 should have been in the bone when the animal was alive, scientist can estimate how long the animal has been dead. Clever, huh? Actually, it is so clever that Willard Libby won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for it. The key information to know is that the half-life of carbon-14 (the amount of time it takes for half of the original amount of carbon-14 to decay) is about 5,730 years.

Use successive approximation to determine approximately when there will be over 1,700 school children in the district whose first language is not English. Display your work in a table. Round your answer to the nearest year.   Show how to solve the equation to calculate exactly when there will be over 1,700 school children in the district whose first language is not English.  "

Name the variables including units.   Write an equation describing the jackpot. Hint: find the daily growth factor.    By what percentage does the jackpot increase each day?   What will the jackpot be after 20 more days (after 37 days total)?  "

  "body": " The creeping vine is taking over Fiona's front lawn. Write for the area covered by the vine (in square feet) and for time in years since she moved into her house.   When Fiona moved in, vine covered about 3 square feet. She believes it has doubled each year since. Write an exponential equation showing how the area covered by the vine is a function of time. Stuck? Try making a table first.    At some point the vine will take over the entire lawn, so perhaps a saturation model would be better. That equation might be Another equation would be a logistic model.

  "body": " Many different agencies are working to lower infant mortality. Infant mortality is measured in deaths per thousand births. The world infant mortality rate in 1955 was around 52 (per thousand births). By the year 2000, it was down to around 23. Source: Wikipedia (Infant Mortality)    Name the variables, including units and dependence.   Write a linear equation modeling infant mortality.   Now write an exponential equation modeling infant mortality.   Compare the models' projections for 1955, 1970, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020. Summarize your findings in a table.   The actual rates were 40 deaths per thousand births in 1970 and 28 deaths per thousand births in 1990. Which model fits this additional data better?  "
