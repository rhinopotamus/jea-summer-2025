Two minutes later, it had dropped to 153 beats per minute, and by ten minutes after practice it was down to 120 beats per minute.   Make a table showing Rashad's heart rate at each time.   Identify the variables, including units and dependence.   How quickly was Rashad's heart rate dropping during the first two minutes following practice? Hint: the units are beats per minute per minute.    How quickly was his heart rate dropping during the next time period?   Rashad does not like hitting the showers until his heart rate is close to normal, or at least below 100. He usually waits 15 minutes after practice. Do you think that's long enough? Explain.

An insurance deductible is the amount you pay for any claim before the insurance company starts paying. Lee's automobile insurance deductible started at $500, but they take off $10 for each month where he has no accidents or tickets. For example, after 1 month his deductible was $490, after 2 months it was $480, and so on.   Name the variables, including units and dependence.   Make a table showing the deductible after 6 months, 1 year, or 3 years without an accident or ticket.   When would the deductible vanish ? (Meaning, when is it $0?)   Write an equation showing how the deductible decreases.   What is the slope and what does it mean in the story?   What is the intercept and what does it mean in the story?    Our investment club has been tracking the performance of a biofuel company's stock over the past year. Using an econometrics software package, we found the equation which describes the value of each share of stock $ as a function of time , measured in weeks starting exactly one year ago.

We are thinking about buying some stock now, and selling it in 10 weeks. Does the equation say that's a good idea? Explain.   10 weeks from now is not because we started counting weeks one year ago.   Looking back over the past year, how low did the value of the stock get? Use successive approximation to estimate to the nearest cent.    Cicely wants to buy a new car that costs $19,400. The dealership offers 6.18% compounded monthly for a 5 year loan.

By comparison, a gas heating system costs approximately $12,000 to install and $700 per year to run Source: Using Algebra by Ethan Bolker . (Story also appears in 4.2 Exercises)    What is the total cost for installing and running a gas heating system for 30 years?   Name variables and write a linear equation showing how the total cost for a gas heating system depends on the number of years you run it.   Name variables and write a linear equation showing how the total cost for a solar heating system depends on the number of years you run it.   If you install and run a solar heating system, how many years can you use it before it costs the same as installing and running a gas heating system for 30 years (your answer to part (a))?

What does the 359 mean in the story and what are its units?   What does the 12 mean in the story and what are its units?

Set up and solve an equation.   Sareth decided to purchase a e-book reader when the price fell below $100. How many months after its release did the price of the e-book reader fall below that level? Set up and solve an inequality.   If you can believe what you read in blogs, the manufacturer will soon be giving away the e-book reader for free, since they make money on the e-book sales themselves. How many months after it was released would that happen, according to our equation? Set up and solve an equation.  "

  "body": " As people age they experience some hearing loss. A study was done to determine the comfort level of sound for people of different ages, meaning the loudest sound (in decibels) that the person could listen to comfortably. The data are given in the table.    Name  Akbar  Javier  Walter  Xang  Rolf  Derrick  Iago  Raheem    Age  45  45  55  65  75  75  85  85    Comfort level  58  61  63  71  75  80  82  79     Make a scatterplot showing the data. Scale your axes to start at 40 years and start the level at 55 decibels. Spread out your scale to get a large, detailed graph.    Draw the line through the points listed for Xang and Rolf. Explain why that line does not fit the data well. Label this line B.    The best-fitting line from statistics has equation where is the person's age (in years) and is the comfort level (in decibels). Make a table showing the values of when A = 40, 60, and 80. Use those points to add this best-fitting line to your graph.  "

The first model costs $645 and then $13.29 per month to run. A more efficient model costs $940 and then $7.82 per month to run.

Answer and indicate the point on the graph where you can check.   The problem continues …   Set up and solve a system of linear equations to find the payback time exactly .   If the manufacturer offers a $25 rebate on the more efficient model, how does that change the payback time? Adjust your equation and set up and solve a new system. Or carefully explain some other way of figuring it out.    It has been a long time since anyone broke the record for the men's long jump. In 1935 Jesse Owens jumped 8.13 meters. The record was next broken 25 years later, in 1960, by Ralph Boston who jumped 8.21 meters. He broke his own record several times over the next few years, including being surpassed briefly by Igor Ter-Ovanesyan. Ralph's final record was 8.35 meters in 1965. Not to be outdone, Igor tied the record in 1967. Then in 1968, Bob Beamon jumped 8.90 meters. That record held for 23 years, until Mike Powell jumped 8.95 meters in 1991, much to Carl Lewis' dismay. Powell's record still stood 21 years later, in 2012. Source: Wikipedia (Long Jump)     Draw in the line connecting the data from 1935 and 1991. Use it to predict the long jump record in 2020.

Arjun just graduated from college but is living with his uncle for the summer to save money. They agreed that Arjun would do chores and some light renovations instead of paying rent. Arjun has been doing around 5 hours of work a week for the past 8 weeks, but still owes his uncle another 30 hours of work.   What was the original agreement? That means, how many hours of work did Arjun originally promise his uncle?   Name the variables and write an equation relating them, assuming Arjun continues to do 5 hours a week of work.   How many more weeks will it take Arjun to finish the work he promised? Show how to solve the equation.    The local zoning commission is considering a plan to expand housing in the city, as measured in the number of residential units. But with more residential units come more shops, offices, schools, recreational facilities, churches, and other commercial property. Currently the city has 3,500 residential units and 1,575 acres of commercial property. If the proposal is passed and completed, the city will have a new total of 3,600 residential units and 1,620 acres of commercial property. You can assume this increase is linear.   Name the variables and summarize the given information in a table.   How many new acres of commercial property are there for each new residential unit built?   Write an equation relating the variables. Hint: first find the intercept.    If the city decides to limit the amount of land to 1,600 acres of commercial property, approximately how many residential units can there be? Use successive approximation, displaying your guesses in a table.   Now answer the question exactly by setting up and solving an inequality.   "
