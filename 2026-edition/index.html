    <h2>2026 Edition</h2>
    

    <p>The 2026 edition is an overhaul of the 2024 PreTeXt source, with a laundry list of improvements.</p>
<h4>Activities</h4>
<p>Perhaps the single most replicated finding in all of educational research is that <em>students learn when they do things</em>, rather than by passively listening to or reading information. The chief contribution of this edition, the new Activities in Chapters 1-5, engage students in the work of the classroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Each section begins with an <strong>Opening Activity</strong> suitable for pre-class homework or in-class warmup. These Opening Activities remind students of something important from a previous section, introduce a key new idea, or refresh their memory of something they learned in K-12.</li>
<li>In parallel with the running example in each section, <strong>inline Activities</strong> gently lead students through (usually) Exercise 1 in the workbook. These Activities are suitable for in-class work individually or in small groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Workbook improvements</h4>
<p>The workbook accompanying the main text is a key part of <em>JEA</em>'s approach. Designed to be printed and written on, it contains Exercises 1-4 from each section, rendered with writing space for each task, graph paper, and formula references. The 2026 edition improves the workbook in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A common task across most of the problems in this book is to <strong>name the variables</strong>. For each of the related quantities in a story, students identify a letter name, write a description in everyday words, identify the units, and decide on dependence. We've now included a <strong>scaffolding table</strong> to help students remember all the parts of the name-the-variables task.</li>
<li>
<p>Another common pattern of thought in this text is <strong>successive approximation</strong> (or "fancy guess and check," as one of my students called it). Through repeatedly evaluating a function and comparing the result to a desired value, we can produce approximate solutions to equations even without knowing the algebraic methods for exact solutions. We've now included a <strong>scaffolding table</strong> for successive approximation tasks to help students remember what we mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By borrowing some space from the top and bottom margins, we've included even more writing space on each page.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ease-of-use and accessibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>Each section is now broken into several <strong>subsections</strong>; PreTeXt automatically generates links to each subsection for easier navigation and direction.</li>
<li>Most diagrams are now rendered in <a href="https://prefigure.org/"><strong>PreFigure</strong></a>, a free and open-source system for creating diagrams that are accessible to screen readers and can be easily rendered in a tactile format.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Coming soon</h4>
<p>As I teach from this book in the Spring 2026 semester, I'll be generating more useful resources, including:
- typeset solutions to each Activity and Exercise
- a static pdf version of the textbook
