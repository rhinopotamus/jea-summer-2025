			Moose bought a commemorative football jersey for $150 twelve years ago. Now he is planning to sell it and is interested in what the <term>effective return</term> (equivalent annual percent increase) on his investment might be for various prices. If $<m>J</m> is the current value of the jersey and <m>g</m> is the annual growth factor, then <me>J=150g^{12}</me> For each part, first solve for <m>g</m> using the <alert>Root Formula<alert>, then calculate <m>r=g-1</m>. The effective return is <m>r</m> written as a percentage.
