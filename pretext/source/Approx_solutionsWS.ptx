			Suppose the gas tank of a car is designed to hold enough fuel to drive 350 miles. (That’s fairly average.) A hybrid car with fuel efficiency of 50 miles per gallon (mpg) would only need a 7 gallon gas tank, but a recreational vehicle that gets only 10 mpg would need a 35 gallon gas tank. <em>Story also appears in 3.3 #3</em>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables including units. The way the story is stated, the size tank is a function of the fuel efficiency.

			Write an equation describing this function.

			My Honda Accord’s tank holds about 16 gallons. Approximate the corresponding fuel efficiency to one decimal place.

					<p>
			My ex-husband’s Honda Civic’s tank holds only 13 gallons. Approximate the corresponding fuel efficiency to one decimal place.
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph showing how the size tank depends on the fuel efficiency.

			After China, India, and the United States, the next five most populous countries (in 2011) are Indonesia, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Bangladesh. Their projected growth rates and corresponding equation are listed below. Here <m>Q</m> is the population measured in millions and <m>Y</m> is the years since 2011.
