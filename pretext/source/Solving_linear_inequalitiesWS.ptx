			One variety of blueberry plant yields an average of 130 blueberries per season but there is quite a bit of variability from plant to plant. One measure of this variability is the standard deviation, which is approximated at 16.4 berries. Given a plant yielding <m>B</m> blueberries, we can calculate how usual or unusual that is by computing its <term>(standard) z-score</term> using the equation <me>Z = \frac{B-130}{16.4}</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, a plant yielding <m>B=130</m> blueberries has z-score of 0. A plant yielding <m>B = 138</m> blueberries has z-score of <me>Z=\frac{138-130}{16.4} = (\underline{138}-130)\div 16.4 = .0.4878\ldots \approx .48</me> Answer each question by evaluating; setting up and solving an equation; or setting up and solving an inequality, whichever is appropriate.
