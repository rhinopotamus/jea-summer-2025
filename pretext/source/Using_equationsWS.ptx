			Dontrell and Kim borrowed money to buy a house on a 30-year mortgage. After <m>M</m> months of making payments, Dontrell and Kim will still owe $<m>D</m> where <me>D=\text{236,000}-\text{56,000} \ast 1.004^M</me> <m>D</m> is also known as the <term>payoff</term> (how much they would need to pay to settle the debt).

			How much did Dontrell and Kim originally borrow to buy their house? What value of <m>M</m> did you evaluate at to answer the question?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Evaluate the equation at <m>M=12</m> and explain what the answer means in terms of the story.

			After making half the payments, how much money will Dontrell and Kim still owe on the house? Will they have paid more or less (or exactly) half of the loan? <em>Hint: convert 30 years into months to find the total number of payments. Then divide by 2 to find the halfway point.</em>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The very last month they do not actually pay the regular monthly payment, just whatever balance is left on the loan. How much will that be? <em>Hint: they will have made all but one of the payments.</em>

			<q>Rose gold</q> is a mix of gold and copper. We start with 2 grams of an alloy that is equal parts gold and copper and add <m>A</m> grams of pure gold to lighten the color. The percentage of gold in the resulting rose gold alloy, <m>R</m> is given by <me>R = 100\left(\frac{1+A}{2+A}\right)</me> For example, if we add 0.8 grams of pure gold, then <m>A=.8</m> and so the percentage is <me>R=100\left(\frac{1+.8}{2+.8}\right)= 100 \times (1 + \underline{.8})\div(2+\underline{.8})=64.28571428\ldots \approx 64.3\%</me>

			Calculate the percentage of gold in the alloy if we add 1.2 grams of pure gold.

			Fill in that and the rest of the missing values.

			Valerie plans to do a 3-day, 50-mile walk to raise money for breast cancer research, in honor of her aunt. Valerie’s friends have pledged a total of $93 per mile.
