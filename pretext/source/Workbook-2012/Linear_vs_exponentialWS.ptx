			<alert>Rate of Change/Slope (of Linear) Formula:<alert> <me>\displaystyle \text{rate of change = }\frac{\text{1st dep - 2nd dep}}{\text{1st indep - 2nd indep}}</me>

			<alert>Growth Factor Formula:<alert>
		</p>

		<p>
			If a quantity is growing (decaying) exponentially, then the growth (decay) factor is <me>\displaystyle g = \sqrt[t]{\frac{a}{s}}</me> where <m>s</m> is the starting amount and <m>a</m> is the amount after <m>t</m> time periods.
		</p>

		<p>
			<alert>Percent Change Formula:<alert>
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			If a quantity changes by a percentage corresponding to growth rate <m>r</m>, then the growth factor is <me>\displaystyle g=1+r</me>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			If the growth factor is <m>g</m>, then the growth rate is <me>r = g-1</me>

			My parents bought the house I grew up in for $35,000 and sold it 40 years later for $342,000. True story. (It was before the housing bubble burst.)
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>First, assume the value of the house increased exponentially.</term>

			In this model, by what percentage did the house value increase each year? <em>Hint: use the <alert>Percent Change Formula<alert>.</em>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an exponential equation showing how the value of the house increased. Don’t forget to name the variables, including units. <em>Hint: use the <alert>Exponential Equation Template<alert>.</em>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			In this model, by what fixed amount did the house value increase each year? <em>Hint: calculate the slope using the <alert>Rate of Change/Slope (of Linear) Formula<alert>.</em>

					<p>
			Using the same variables, write a linear equation showing how the value of the house increased. <em>Hint: use the <alert>Linear Equation Template<alert>.</em>

			The number of manufacturing jobs in the state has been declining for decades. In 1970, there were 1.2 million such jobs in the state but by 2010 there were only .6 million such jobs. Write <m>J</m> for the number of manufacturing jobs (in millions) and <m>Y</m> for the years since 1970.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>First, assume the number of jobs decreased linearly.</term>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>

			<li>
					<p>
