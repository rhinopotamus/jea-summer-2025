		<title>A first look at linear equations – Practice exercises</title>

			A truck hauling bags of grass seed pulls into a weigh station along the highway. Trucks are weighed to determine the amount of highway tax. This particular truck weighs pounds when it is empty. Each bag of grass seed it carries weighs 4.2 pounds. For example, a truck is carrying bags of grass seed weighs <me>\text{3,900 pounds } + \frac{4.2 \text{ pounds}}{\text{bag}} \ast \text{1,000  bags} = \text{3,900} + 4.2\times\text{1,000}=\text{8,100 pounds}</me> In official trucking lingo, we say the <term>curb weight</term> of pounds plus the <term>load weight</term> of pounds results in a <term>gross weight</term> of pounds. So, now you know. <em>Story also appears in 3.1#1 and 3.2 #1</em>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Calculate the gross weight of the truck if it contains bags of grass seed.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables, including units, and write an equation showing how the gross weight of the truck is a function of the number of bags of grass seed.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Identify the slope and intercept, along with their units, and explain what each means in terms of the story.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The bags of grass seed are piled on wood <term>pallets</term> (sturdy platforms) to make them more stable for moving. How much does the truck weigh if it is carrying 12 pallets, where each pallet weighs 15 pounds and holds 96 bags of grass seed?

			The water in the local reservoir was 47 feet deep but there has been so little rain that the depth has fallen 18 inches a week over the past few months. Officials are worried if dry conditions continue the reservoir will not have enough water to supply the town.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables and write an equation relating them. First convert 18 inches to feet.
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			Identify the slope and intercept, along with their units, and explain what each means in terms of the story.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table of values showing the projected depth of the reservoir after 1 week, 5 weeks, 10 weeks, and 20 weeks if the current trend continues.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph illustrating the function.

			I was short on cash so I got a <term>line of credit</term> (short term loan) on my bank account, of which I spent $. That means my account balance is <m>-</m>$. I will pay back the interest plus an extra $250 each month. When the loan is paid off, I plan to continue to deposit $250 per month to start saving.

			A mug of coffee costs $3.45 at Juan’s favorite cafe, unless he buys their discount card for $10 in which case each mug costs $2.90. <em>Story also appears in 1.2 #4 and 4.2 #2</em>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables, including units.

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an equation describing how the total cost depends on how many mugs of coffee Juan buys, assuming he does not buy the discount card.

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an equation describing how the total cost depends on how many mugs of coffee Juan buys, if he buys the discount card.
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			How would the equation change if the cafe offers a new annual membership card that cost $59.99 that entitles Juan to buy coffee for only $1 per mug all year?
