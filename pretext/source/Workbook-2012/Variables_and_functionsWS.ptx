			<li>
					<p>
			Identify and name the variables, including the units.

			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Which variable is dependent and which is independent?
		</p>

		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Identify and name the variables, including the units.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Explain the dependence using a sentence of the form <q> is a function of </q>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Which number is a constant in this story: the percent increase (7.2) or the apartment rent (830)?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What is a realistic domain for this function? That means, for how many years might this sort of increase in rent continue? Express your answer as an inequality.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What is the average rent expected to be in 1 year? In 2 years? In 3 years? Note that <me>7.2\% = \frac{7.2}{100} = 7.2 \div 100 = .072</me> Try figuring it out.
