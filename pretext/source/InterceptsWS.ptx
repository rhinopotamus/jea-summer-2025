		<title>Intercepts and direct proportionality – Practice exercises</title>

			In each of the following stories, the temperature changes over time. It might be confusing to call either variable <m>T</m>, so use <m>H</m> for the time in hours and <m>D</m> for the temperature in degrees (<m>^{\circ}</m>F). In each case, time should be measured from the start of the story.

			It was really cold at 8:30 this morning when Raina arrived at the office. Luckily the heating system warms things up very quickly, 4<m>^\circ</m>F per hour. By 11:00 a.m. it was a very comfortable 72<m>^\circ</m> F.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Figure out what the temperature was at 8:30 a.m.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an equation illustrating the function.
		</p>

			While 72<m>^\circ</m>F is a perfectly good temperature for an office, not so for ballroom dancing. When Raina arrived for her practice at 5:30 that evening, she began to sweat before she even took the floor. Turns out the air conditioner had been running since 4:00 p.m. but it only cools down the room 3<m>^\circ</m>F per hour.

			Maryn is very happy. Her interior design business is finally showing a profit. She has logged a total of 471 billable hours at $35 per hour since she started her business. Accounting for start up costs, her net profit is totals $.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			What were Maryn’s start up costs?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Identify the slope and intercept (including their units and sign) and explain what each means in terms of the story.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Calculate what Maryn’s profits will be once she has logged a total of hours.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables and write an equation relating them.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Graph the function.

			For each story, find the initial weight of the person and use it to write an equation showing how the person’s weight <m>P</m> pounds depends on the time, <m>W</m> weeks.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Jerome has gained weight since he took his power training to the next level ten weeks ago, at the rate of around 1 pound a week. He now weighs 198 pounds.

			<li>
					<p>
			Vanessa’s doctor put her on a sensible diet and exercise plan to get her back to a healthy weight. She will need to lose an average of 1.25 pounds a week to reach her goal weight of 148 pounds in a year. Use <m>1 \text{ year} =  52 \text{ weeks}</m>.

			After the past 6 weeks of terrible migrane headaches, Carlos is down to 158 pounds. He has lost 4 pounds a week.

					<p>
			Since she has been pregnant, Zoe has gained the recommended pound per week. Now 30 weeks pregnant and 168 pounds, she wonders if she will ever see her feet again.

					<p>
			Each story describes a situation that we are assuming is linear. Decide whether it is <term>proportional</term>, meaning the intercept equals zero. If it is not proportional, explain what the intercept would mean in the story.

			The price of kiwis depends on how many kiwis you buy. <em><term>Kiwi</term> is a fruit.</em>

			The price of a bag of tortillas depends on how many tortillas are in the bag.

			The time it takes to vacuum a rug depends on the area of the rug.

			The time it takes to wash dishes depends on how many dirty dishes there are.
		</p>

			The amount of laundry detergent I have left depends on how many loads of laundry I did.

			<term>When you’re done …</term>
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Check your solutions. Still confused? Work with a classmate, instructor, or tutor.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Try the <term>Do you know</term> questions. Not sure? Read the textbook and try again.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Make a list of key ideas and process to remember under <term>Don’t forget!</term>
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Do the textbook exercises and check your answers. Not sure if you are close enough? Compare answers with a classmate or ask your instructor or tutor.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Getting the wrong answers or stuck? Re-read the section and try again. If you are still stuck, work with a classmate or go to your instructor’s office hours or tutor hours.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.

			<term>Do you know …</term>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			What the intercept of a linear function means in the story and what it tells us about the graph?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			How to calculate the intercept given the slope and an example (another point on the graph)?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Why an intercept might not make sense, for example if it’s outside the domain of the function?
		</p>
