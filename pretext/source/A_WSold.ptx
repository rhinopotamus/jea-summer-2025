				A truck hauling bags of grass seed pulls into a weigh station along the highway. Trucks are weighed to determine the amount of highway tax. This particular truck weighs pounds when it is empty. Each bag of grass seed it carries weighs 4.2 pounds. For example, a truck is carrying bags of grass seed weighs <me>\text{3,900 pounds } + \frac{4.2 \text{ pounds}}{\text{bag}} \ast \text{1,000  bags} = \text{3,900} + 4.2\times\text{1,000}=\text{8,100 pounds}</me> In official trucking lingo, we say the <term>curb weight</term> of pounds plus the <term>load weight</term> of pounds results in a <term>gross weight</term> of pounds.

				Is laughter really the best medicine? A study examined the impact of comedy on anxiety levels. Subjects’ anxiety levels were rated on a scale of 1 to 5 before and after the study.

				One variety of blueberry plant yields an average of 130 blueberries per season but there is quite a bit of variability from plant to plant.

Not to be outdone, Luigi offers to unclog any drain for $150, no matter how long it takes. For each plumber, the table lists the corresponding equation and several points.

				The <term>supply</term> of flour is the amount of flour produced. It depends on the price of flour. A high price encourages producers to make more flour. If the price is low, they tend to make less of it. The dependence of the supply of flour S (in loads) on the price P (in $/pound) is given by the equation

				It has been a long time since anyone broke the record for the men’s long jump. In 1935 Jesse Owens jumped 8.13 meters. The record was next broken 25 years later, in 1960, by Ralph Boston who jumped 8.21 meters. He broke his own record several times over the next few years, including being surpassed briefly by Igor Ter-Ovanesyan. Ralph’s final record was 8.35 meters in 1965. Not to be outdone, Igor tied the record in 1967. Then in 1968, Bob Beamon jumped 8.90 meters. That record held for 23 years, until Mike Powell jumped 8.95 meters in 1991, much to Carl Lewis’ dismay. Powell’s record still stood 21 years later, in 2012.

				Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations are related to global climate change. In 1980, the carbon dioxide concentration was 338 ppm (parts per million). At that time it was assumed that carbon dioxide concentrations would increase .42% per year.

				Have you read news stories about archaeological digs where a specimen (like a bone) is found that dates back thousands of years? How do scientists know how old something is? One method uses the radioactive decay of carbon. After an animal dies the carbon-14 in its body very slowly decays. By comparing how much carbon-14 remains in the bone to how much carbon-14 should have been in the bone when the animal was alive, scientist can estimate how long the animal has been dead. Clever, huh? Actually, it is so clever that Willard Libby won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for it. The key information to know is that the half-life of carbon-14 is about years. For this problem, suppose a bone were found that should have contained 300 milligrams of carbon-14 when the animal was alive.

				One of the toxic radioactive elements produced by nuclear power plants is strontium-90. A large amount of strontium-90 was released in the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the 1980’s. The clouds carried the strontium-90 great distances. The rain washed it down into the grass, which was eaten by cows. People then drank the milk from the cows. Unfortunately, strontium-90 causes cancer. Strontium-90 is particularly dangerous because it has a half-life of approximately 28 years, which means that every 28 years half of the existing strontium-90 changes into a safe product; the other half remains strontium-90. Suppose that a person drank milk containing 100 milligrams of strontium-90.

				The creeping vine is taking over Fiona’s front lawn. Write <m>V</m> for the area covered by the vine (in square feet) and <m>Y</m> for the years since she moved into her house.

				When Fiona moved in, vine covered about 3 square feet. She believes it has doubled each year since. Write an exponential equation showing how the area covered by the vine is a function of time. <em>Stuck? Try making a table first.</em>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				At some point the vine will take over the entire lawn, so perhaps a saturation model would be better. That equation might be <me>V = 170 - 167 \ast .8^Y</me> Another equation would be a logistic model. Perhaps <me>V = \frac{129}{1+ 42 \ast .34^Y}</me> Fill in the corresponding rows of the table for each model.

				Many different agencies are working to lower infant mortality. Infant mortality is measured in deaths per thousand births. The world infant mortality rate in 1955 was around 52 (per thousand births). By the year 2000, it was down to around 23.
