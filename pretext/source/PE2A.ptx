			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you’re not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don’t spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you’re not sure about something.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don’t forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>

					<p>
			United States ethanol production has been growing exponentially. In 1990, there were 0.9 billion gallons of ethanol produced. At that time it was estimated that production would increase 5.5% per year.

			<li>
					<p>
			What is the annual growth factor?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an equation that describes the function.

			<li>
					<p>
			In 2008 actual production of ethanol was 9.0 billion gallons. Is that production level higher or lower than predicted from your equation? Explain.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			When does your equation predict that ethanol production was (or will be) 9.0 billion gallons? Use successive approximation. Display your guesses in a table. Report the actual year.

			An insurance <term>deductible</term> is the amount you pay for any claim before the insurance company starts paying. Lee’s automobile insurance deductible started at $500, but they take off $10 for each month where he has no accidents or tickets. For example, after 1 month his deductible was $490, after 2 months it was $480, and so on.
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Name the variables.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table showing the deductible after 6 months, 1 year, or 3 years without an accident or ticket.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			When would the deductible <term>vanish</term>? (Meaning, when is it $0?)
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Write an equation showing how the deductible decreases.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What is the slope and what does it mean in the story?
		</p>

			<li>

			What is the intercept and what does it mean in the story?

			Our investment club has been tracking the performance of a biofuel company’s stock over the past year. Using an econometrics software package, we found the equation <me>V =.00004W^3 + .01W^2 -.9W + 31</me> which describes the value of each share of stock $<m>V</m> as a function of the week <m>W</m>, starting exactly one year ago.

			Complete the following table of values.

			According to the table, what was the value of the stock when we began tracking it? What is it worth now?
		</p>

			We are thinking about buying some stock now, and selling it in 10 weeks. Does the equation say that’s a good idea? Explain. <em>Hint: 10 weeks from now is not <m>W=10</m> because we started counting weeks one year ago.</em>

			<li>
					<p>
			Looking back over the past year, how low did the value of the stock get? Use successive approximation to estimate to the nearest cent.

			Cicely is working on her monthly budget. She has only $230 per month left after those car payments. If she puts that money into a bank account each month earning 2.91% interest compounded monthly how much will she have after 5 years when the car is paid off? Use the <alert>Future Value Annuity Formula<alert>.
