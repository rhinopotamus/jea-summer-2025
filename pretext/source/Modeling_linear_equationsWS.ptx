			A solar heating system costs approximately $ to install and $150 per year to run. By comparison, a gas heating system costs approximately $ to install and $700 per year to run. <em>Story also appears in 4.2 Exercises</em>

			What is the total cost for installing and running a gas heating system for 30 years?

			<li>
					<p>
			Write a linear equation showing how the total cost for a gas heating system depends on the number of years you run it.

			Write a linear equation showing how the total cost for a solar heating system depends on the number of years you run it.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			If you install and run a solar heating system, how many years can you use it before it costs the same as installing and running a gas heating system for 30 years (your answer to part (a))? Set up and solve an equation.

			Since a very popular e-book reader was released, the price has been decreasing at a constant rate. A blogger developed the following equation representing the price <m>E</m> of the e-book reader in the months <m>M</m> since it was released. <me>E = 359 - 12M</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			Make a table of values for the e-book reader price initially, after 10 months, and after 25 months.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What does the 359 mean in the story and what are its units?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What does the 12 mean in the story and what are its units?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Draw a graph illustrating the dependence.

			After approximately how many months was the price of the e-book reader expected to be down to $200? Set up and solve an equation.
		</p>

			<li>

			Sareth decided to purchase a e-book reader when the price fell below $100. How many months after its release did the price of the e-book reader fall below that level? Set up and solve an inequality.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			If you can believe what you read in blogs, the manufacturer will soon be giving away the e-book reader for free, since they make money on the e-book sales themselves. How many months after it was released would that happen, according to our equation? Set up and solve an equation.

			Can you tell from the table which of these functions are linear? Use the rate of change to help you decide. Remember that these numbers may have been rounded.

			Plumbers are really expensive, so I have been comparing prices. James charges $50 to show up plus $120 per hour. Jo is just getting started in the business. She charges $45 to show up plus $55 per hour. Mario advertises <q>no trip charge</q> but his hourly rate is $90 per hour. Not to be outdone, Luigi offers to unclog any drain for $150, no matter how long it takes. For each plumber, the table lists the corresponding equation and several points. In each equation, the plumber charges $<m>P</m> for <m>T</m> hours of work. <em>Story also appears in 2.1 Exercises</em>
