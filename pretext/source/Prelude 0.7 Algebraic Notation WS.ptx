				Since she has been pregnant, Zoe has gained the recommended <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> pound per week. She weighted 153 pounds at the start of her pregnancy. That means when she is <m>W</m> weeks pregnant, that Zoe weighs <me>153 + \frac{1}{2}W</me> What does this expression say Zoe will weigh when she’s 40 weeks pregnant?

				Astra lives in a 1-bedroom apartment where they pay $825 per month in rent. Thanks to new rent stabilization laws, Astra’s rent can only increase 3% per year. That means after <m>Y</m> years, their rent will be at most <me>825(1.03^Y)</me> What does this expression say her rent could be in 5 years?
