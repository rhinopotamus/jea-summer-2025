				Jody is using small wooden balls to make noses for her knitted gnomes. She figured out that she can calculate the weight of each ball (in ounces) as <m>.2 \times B \land 3</m> where <m>B</m> is the diameter of the ball (in inches).
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				What does a 2.5 inch diameter wooden ball weigh?
			</p>
				</li>

				Jody is considering building a giant gnome for her office. The nose will be a wooden ball weighing 1 pound. She calculates that the diameter of the ball will be <m>\sqrt[3]{80}</m>. How big is that?
			</p>
				</li>

				The size of a round pizza is described by its diameter. It turns out that we can calculate how many people are served by a pizza of diameter <m>D</m> inches as <m>.015625 \times D \land 2=</m>. For example, a 16-inch diameter pizza serves <m>.015625 \times 16 \land 2 = 4</m> people. (The mysterious number .015625 comes from a little geometry and pizza science.)

				<li>
							<p>
				How many people would be served by a 12-inch pizza?
			</p>
				</li>

				A personal pizza is designed to serve one person. It turns out the diameter of a personal pizza is <m>\sqrt{64}</m>. Calculate the diameter of a personal pizza using the square root key (or just the root key) on your calculator.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				An extra large pizza serves 6 people. It turns out the diameter of an extra large pizza is <m>\sqrt{384}</m>. Calculate the diameter of a personal pizza using the square root key (or just the root key) on your calculator.

				A signal sent down a fiber optic cable decreases by 2% per mile. That means after <m>M</m> miles, its strength is <m>\underbrace{.98 \times .98 \times \cdots \times .98}_{M \text{ times}} = .98 \land M</m>. What is the signal strength after 10 miles? After 20 miles? Note: your answers should be decimal numbers less than 1.

				If Kricia invested $230,000 instead, what would her investment be worth after 40 years? Try to use a power to help answer the question. Hint: how many times will the value of her investment double?
