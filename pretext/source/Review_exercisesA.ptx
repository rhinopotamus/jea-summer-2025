			Relax. You have done problems like these before. Even if these problems look a bit different, just do what you can. If you’re not sure of something, please ask! You may use your calculator. Please show all of your work and write down as many steps as you can. Don’t spend too much time on any one problem. Do well. And remember, ask me if you’re not sure about something.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>As you work, make a <q>don’t forget</q> list of any information you need to look up or ask about.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Caution:</term> These review exercises do not include every possible problem you might be asked on a final exam. For example, there are no problems here from Sections 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 so be sure to ask your instructor which of those sections are going to be on your final exam.

			<li>
					<p>
			Calculate the rate of change from 1958 when production was 4.57 million cars/year to 1971 when it was 9.83 cars million/year. What does that tell you about North American car production during 1958-1971?

			Now calculate the rate of change of from 1984 when production was 9.03 million cars/year to 2006 when it was 6.84 million cars/year. What does that tell you about North American car production during 1984-2006?

			My favorite little black dress is machine washable. Unfortunately each time I wash it the color fades a little. The intensity of black color remaining, <m>B</m>, is a function of the number of times I have washed the dress, <m>W</m>, according to the equation <me>B=100 \ast .985^W</me>
		</p>

		<p><ol>
			<li>
					<p>
			It will still look new as long as the intensity stays above 90%. Set up and solve an equation to figure out how many times I can wash the dress and keep it looking new. Then check some other way.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			By the time only 75% of the color remains, the dress will look too faded to wear formally. How many washes before then? Find the answer to the nearest number of washes by any method you prefer.

			In the United States in 1970, the average person ate calories per day. By 2008 that number had increased to calories per day. Let <m>C</m> be the amount a typical person eats (in calories per day) and <m>Y</m> the year, measured in years since 1970.
