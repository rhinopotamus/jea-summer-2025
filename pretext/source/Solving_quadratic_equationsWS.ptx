			The art museum opened in 1920. After an initial rush to see the great holdings, attendance dropped for awhile. But then attendance began to rise again and has risen since. The number of annual visits <m>N</m> is approximated by the equation <me>N= 51Y^2-840Y+\text{3,700}</me> where <m>Y</m> is the year since 1920.

			Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10’<m>\times</m>25’ vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.

		<p>
			The amount of gravel we need (<m>G</m> cubic feet) is given by the equation <me>G = W^2 + 17.5W</me> where <m>W</m> is the width of the path in feet. For example, a path 4 feet wide requires 86 cubic feet of gravel, as you can check. <em>Story also appears in 2.3 and 2.4 Exercises</em>

					<p>
			If the neighbor donates 60 cubic feet of gravel, how wide a path can they build? Set up and solve a quadratic equation to find the answer to two decimal places in feet. Then convert your answer into inches.

			Gravel is measured by the <term>yard</term>, which is short for cubic yard. There are 27 cubic feet in 1 yard of gravel. If the neighbor donates three yards of gravel, how wide a path can they build? Set up and solve a quadratic equation to find the answer to two decimal places in feet. Then convert your answer into inches.

			What would it mean to solve the equation to find where <m>G=0</m>? Can you tell what the answer is from the equation (without actually solving)?

					<p>
			It is normal to find some parts of exercises difficult, but if most of them are a struggle, meet with your instructor or advisor about possible strategies or support services.
