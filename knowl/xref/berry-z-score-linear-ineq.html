<div class="para">One variety of blueberry plant yields an average of 130 blueberries per season but there is quite a bit of variability from plant to plant. One measure of this variability is the standard deviation, which is approximated at 16.4 berries. Given a plant yielding <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> blueberries, we can calculate how usual or unusual that is by computing its <dfn class="terminology">(standard) z-score</dfn> using the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Z = \frac{B-130}{16.4}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">For example, a plant yielding <span class="process-math">\(B=130\)</span> blueberries has z-score of 0. A plant yielding <span class="process-math">\(B = 138\)</span> blueberries has z-score of</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Z=\frac{138-130}{16.4} = (\underline{138}-130)\div 16.4 = 0.4878\ldots \approx 0.48
