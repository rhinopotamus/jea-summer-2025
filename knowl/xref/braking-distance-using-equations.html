<div class="para">The 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe 4WD will take about 158.1 feet to stop when traveling at 60 mph in normal highway conditions. Let <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> be the speed at which the vehicle is traveling, in miles per hour (mph), and <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> the distance it takes to stop, in feet. This information together with a little physics gives the equation</div>

<div class="para">In driver’s training classes they teach the “two-second rule” for safety: you should follow no closer than two seconds behind the car in front of you. If you are traveling 80 miles per hour, how many feet can you travel in two seconds? <em class="emphasis">Hint: convert to feet per second, then multiply by two seconds.</em>
