<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">It has been a long time since anyone broke the record for the men’s long jump. In 1935 Jesse Owens jumped 8.13 meters. The record was next broken 25 years later, in 1960, by Ralph Boston who jumped 8.21 meters. He broke his own record several times over the next few years, including being surpassed briefly by Igor Ter-Ovanesyan. Ralph’s final record was 8.35 meters in 1965. Not to be outdone, Igor tied the record in 1967. Then in 1968, Bob Beamon jumped 8.90 meters. That record held for 23 years, until Mike Powell jumped 8.95 meters in 1991, much to Carl Lewis’ dismay. Powell’s record still stood 21 years later, in 2012. </div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/longjump.png" class="contained"></div>
