<div class="introduction"><div class="para">One of the toxic radioactive elements produced by nuclear power plants is strontium-90. A large amount of strontium-90 was released in the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the 1980’s. The clouds carried the strontium-90 great distances. The rain washed it down into the grass, which was eaten by cows. People then drank the milk from the cows. Unfortunately, strontium-90 causes cancer. Strontium-90 is particularly dangerous because it has a half-life of approximately 28 years, which means that every 28 years half of the existing strontium-90 changes into a safe product; the other half remains strontium-90. Suppose that a person drank milk containing 100 milligrams of strontium-90. </div></div>
