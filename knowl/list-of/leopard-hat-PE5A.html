<div class="introduction"><div class="para">Leopard print hat. Originally 5 out of 1,000 women shopping at a major retail store even looked twice. But that number grew and grew, by my estimate around 40% a week, thanks to carefully placed ads in fashion magazines.</div></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Write an equation illustrating the interest in leopard print hats using <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> for the time (in weeks) and <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> for the number of women interested in leopard print hats (women per thousand).</div>

<div class="para">Make a table showing the number of women, per thousand female shoppers, who stop and look at the hat at the start, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 3 weeks after it hits the stores.</div>

<div class="para">The leopard print hat is considered popular when more than 300 out of 1,000 women try it on. According to the equation, <em class="emphasis">approximately</em> when will the hat be considered popular? Use successive approximation to find the answer to the nearest week and display your guesses in a table.</div>
<div class="workspace" data-space="0.75in"></div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">The hat will be considered passé when over 750 out of 1,000 women try it on. I mean - everyone’s got one! According to your equation, when will that happen? Set up and solve an equation, again answering to the nearest week.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="ws-PE5A.html#leopard-hat-PE5A">in-context</a></span>
