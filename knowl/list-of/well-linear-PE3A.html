<div class="para">The Skärstroms want to dig a new well for water for their lake cabin. The company charges $900 to bring the equipment on site and draw the permit and then $2 per foot to dig. That means</div>

<div class="para">In their neck of the woods, wells often run 200 feet deep. According to the equation, how much would that cost?</div>

<div class="para">The Skärstroms have budgeted between $1,500 and $1,800 for the well. Set up and solve a chain of inequalities to find the corresponding range of depths.</div>

<div class="para">No such luck. The company had to drill much deeper than hoped to find water. The final result, wonderfully cold and clear drinking water. And, a hefty bill for $2,072. How deep is their well? Set up and solve an equation.</div>
