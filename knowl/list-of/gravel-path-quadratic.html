<div class="para">Urban community gardens are catching on. What was once an abandoned lot down the block is now a thriving 10’<span class="process-math">\(\times\)</span>25’ vegetable and berry garden for the neighborhood. One neighbor volunteered to donate gravel to make a path around the garden. The path will be 3 inches deep and the same width all around.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/GravelPath.png" class="contained"></div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The amount of gravel we need (<span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> cubic feet) is given by the equation</div>

\begin{equation*}
G = W^2 + 17.5W
