        <div><h3>About <em>Just Enough Algebra</em></h3>
<p>In 1994, Dr. Suzanne Dorée and colleagues at Augsburg College had a vision for a new course to replace our intermediate algebra course. We wanted a college level course that would serve primarily as preparation for quantitative courses across the curriculum. The framing question that led to our curricular adventure of the past three decades was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What algebra do college students need to know, and how can we make it relevant to their future studies, their lives as citizens, and their everyday life?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these questions <em>Just Enough Algebra</em> was born.</p>
<p>As you will see, everything we do is in some applied context. Our choices to focus primarily on linear and exponential models; to emphasize verbal, numerical, and graphical interpretation of functions; to develop students' quantitative reasoning; and to include only the most essential symbolic techniques align well with curricular guides from the <a href="https://maa.org/resource/cupm-guide/">MAA</a> and <a href="https://www.amatyc.org/publications/amatyc-standards/beyond-crossroads/">AMATYC</a>. </p>
<p>More importantly, it works. Student learn a lot in this course. They are ready for what comes next. And, they enjoy it.</p>
